*Search query: reasoning processes*

Deductive, Inductive and Abductive Reasoning BC Home > CAS > TIP Sheets > Critical Thinking Skills > TIP Sheet DEDUCTIVE, INDUCTIVE, AND ABDUCTIVE REASONING Reasoning is the process of using existing knowledge to draw conclusions, make predictions, or construct explanations. Three methods of reasoning are the deductive, inductive, and abductive approaches. Deductive reasoning: conclusion guaranteed Deductive reasoning starts with the assertion of a general rule and proceeds from there to a guaranteed specific conclusion. Deductive reasoning moves from the general rule to the specific application: In deductive reasoning, if the original assertions are true, then the conclusion must also be true. For example, math is deductive: If x = 4 And if y = 1 Then 2x + y = 9 In this example, it is a logical necessity that 2x + y equals 9; 2x + y must equal 9. As a matter of fact, formal, symbolic logic uses a language that looks rather like the math equality above, complete with its own operators and syntax. But a deductive syllogism (think of it as a plain-English version of a math equality) can be expressed in ordinary language: If entropy (disorder) in a system will increase unless energy is expended, And if my living room is a system, Then disorder will increase in my living room unless I clean it. In the syllogism above, the first two statements, the propositions or premises , lead logically to the third statement, the conclusion . Here is another example: A medical technology ought to be funded if it has been used successfully to treat patients. Adult stem cells are being used to treat patients successfully in more than sixty-five new therapies. Adult stem cell research and technology should be funded. A conclusion is sound (true) or unsound (false), depending on the truth of the original premises (for any premise may be true or false). At the same time, independent of the truth or falsity of the premises, the deductive inference itself (the process of "connecting the dots" from premise to conclusion) is either valid or invalid . The inferential process can be valid even if the premise is false: There is no such thing as drought in the West. California is in the West. California need never make plans to deal with a drought. In the example above, though the inferential process itself is valid, the conclusion is false because the premise, There is no such thing as drought in the West , is false. A syllogism yields a false conclusion if either of its propositions is false. A syllogism like this is particularly insidious because it looks so very logical–it is, in fact, logical. But whether in error or malice, if either of the propositions above is wrong, then a policy decision based upon it ( California need never make plans to deal with a drought ) probably would fail to serve the public interest. Assuming the propositions are sound, the rather stern logic of deductive reasoning can give you absolutely certain conclusions. However, deductive reasoning cannot really increase human knowledge (it is nonampliative ) because the conclusions yielded by deductive reasoning are tautologies -statements that are contained within the premises and virtually self-evident. Therefore, while with deductive reasoning we can make observations and expand implications, we cannot make predictions about future or otherwise non-observed phenomena. Inductive reasoning: conclusion merely likely Inductive reasoning begins with observations that are specific and limited in scope, and proceeds to a generalized conclusion that is likely, but not certain, in light of accumulated evidence. You could say that inductive reasoning moves from the specific to the general. Much scientific research is carried out by the inductive method: gathering evidence, seeking patterns, and forming a hypothesis or theory to explain what is seen. Conclusions reached by the inductive method are not logical necessities; no amount of inductive evidence guarantees the conclusion. This is b...

*Search query: logic and argumentation*

Logic of argumentation Article Talk The logic of argumentation (LA) is a formalised description of the ways in which humans reason and argue about propositions . It is used, for example, in computer artificial intelligence systems in the fields of medical diagnosis and prognosis , and research chemistry . Contents 1 Origin of term 2 Implementations 3 See also 4 References Origin of term edit Krause et al. [ 1 ] appear to have been the first authors to use the term "logic of argumentation" in a paper about their model for using argumentation for qualitative reasoning under uncertainty, although the approach had been used earlier in prototype computer applications to support medical diagnosis. [ 2 ] [ 3 ] Their ideas have been developed further, [ 4 ] [ 5 ] and used in applications for predicting chemical toxicity and xenobiotic metabolism , for example. [ 6 ] [ 7 ] Implementations edit In LA, arguments for and arguments against a proposition are distinct; an argument for a proposition contributes nothing to the case against it, and vice versa. Among other things, this means that LA can support contradiction – proof that an argument is true and that it is false. Arguments supporting the case for and arguments supporting the case against are aggregated separately, leading to a single assessment of confidence in the case for and a single assessment of confidence in the case against. Then the two are resolved to provide a single measure of confidence in the proposition. In most implementations of LA the default aggregated value is equal to the strongest value in the set of arguments for or against the proposition. Having more than one argument in agreement does not automatically increase confidence because it cannot be assumed that the arguments are independent when reasoning under uncertainty . If there is evidence that arguments are independent and there is a case for increased confidence when they agree, this is sometimes expressed in additional rules of the form "If A and B then ...". The process of aggregation and resolution can be represented as follows: T = Resolve[Max{For(Ca,x, Cb,y, ...)}, Max{Against(Ca,x, Cb,y, ...)}] where T is the overall assessment of confidence in a proposition; Resolve[] is a function which returns the single confidence value which is the resolution of any pair of values; For and Against are the sets of arguments supporting and opposing the proposition, respectively; Ca,x, Cb,y, ..., are the confidence values for those arguments; Max{...} is a function which returns the strongest member of the set upon which it operates (For or Against). Arguments may assign confidence to propositions that themselves influence confidence in other arguments, and one rule may be undercut by another. A computer implementation can recognize these interrelationships to construct reasoning trees automatically.

Philosophical Questions that Shape Human Existence Unveiling the Enigma: Exploring the Profound Philosophical Questions that Define the Essence of Human Existence October 16, 2023 Photo by JC Bonassin on Unsplash Introduction: Human existence is surrounded by a multitude of questions that have puzzled philosophers and thinkers throughout history. These questions not only challenge our understanding of the world but also shape our perspectives and actions. In this article, we will explore some of the fundamental philosophical questions that underpin human existence, highlighting their importance and influence on our lives. What is the Meaning of Life? One of the most profound and enduring philosophical questions is the search for the meaning of life. Is there a purpose or ultimate goal to our existence? This question has fascinated philosophers from different traditions and has given rise to various theories and perspectives. One notable exploration of this question is found in Viktor Frankl's book Man's Search for Meaning . Frankl, a Holocaust survivor and psychiatrist, argued that the search for meaning is what drives us as humans. He posited that the meaning of life can be found through personal commitment and the pursuit of worthwhile endeavors. Others, like existentialists Albert Camus and Jean-Paul Sartre, argue for the inherent absurdity of existence. They propose that life has no predetermined meaning and it is up to each individual to create their own sense of purpose and significance in an indifferent world. What is Personal Identity? Another crucial question that shapes human existence is the nature of personal identity. What makes us who we are? Are we defined by our memories, physical attributes, or some deeper essence? Philosopher John Locke, in his work An Essay Concerning Human Understanding , put forth the theory of personal identity as continuity of consciousness. According to Locke, our personal identity lies in the continuous stream of consciousness and the memories and experiences associated with it. In contrast, Buddhist philosophy challenges the notion of a stable, enduring self. Buddhists argue for the concept of anatta, or "no-self," positing that personal identity is an illusion created by the mind. Instead, identity is seen as a collection of impermanent elements and processes. What is the Nature of Reality? The question of the nature of reality lies at the core of philosophical inquiry. How do we know what is real? Is there an objective reality, or is it shaped by our perceptions and subjective experiences? René Descartes famously explored this question in his Meditations on First Philosophy . Adopting a skeptical approach, Descartes initially doubted the reliability of his senses and questioned the existence of an external world. Nevertheless, he reasoned that his ability to doubt and think was evidence of his existence, leading to his famous statement, "Cogito, ergo sum" or "I think, therefore I am." In contrast, George Berkeley proposed an idealist perspective, arguing that reality is entirely dependent on perception and the mind. According to Berkeley, to be is to be perceived. That is, objects exist only when they are perceived by a conscious mind. What is the Right Thing to Do? Ethical questions play a fundamental role in shaping human existence. How should we act? What is the basis for moral judgments? These questions have given rise to various ethical theories and frameworks. Immanuel Kant's deontological theory, outlined in his work Groundwork of the Metaphysics of Morals , proposes that ethical actions should be guided by the principle of universalizability. In other words, an action is morally right only if it can be willed as a universal law that applies to all individuals. Utilitarianism, developed by philosophers like Jeremy Bentham and John Stuart Mill, takes a consequentialist approach to ethics. According to this theory, actions are morally right if they produce the greatest overall...

*Search query: origins of human curiosity*

The History of Human Curiosity: From Myths to the Scientific Revolution December 1, 2024 Curiosity has always been a defining trait of humanity. From the earliest flickers of consciousness, humans have gazed at the stars, questioned the natural world, and sought to understand the mysteries of existence. This innate curiosity has fueled myths, inspired revolutions, and ultimately paved the way for the modern world. To truly appreciate the achievements of the Scientific Revolution, we must first explore the rich history of human curiosity that preceded it. — The Dawn of Myths: Curiosity in Early Cultures In ancient times, humans relied on myths to explain the unexplainable. Why does the sun rise and set? Why do seasons change? How did the universe come into being? Myths served as humanity’s earliest attempts to answer these profound questions. Civilizations like the Sumerians, Egyptians, and Greeks created elaborate stories featuring gods, heroes, and cosmic battles. For instance, the ancient Greeks attributed natural phenomena to the whims of gods such as Zeus, Poseidon, and Demeter. These myths were not only entertaining but also vital frameworks for understanding a mysterious world. Curiosity was embedded in these stories. The tale of Prometheus, who stole fire from the gods to give to humanity, symbolizes the human desire to grasp forbidden knowledge. Similarly, the Epic of Gilgamesh explores themes of mortality and the search for eternal life—questions that continue to intrigue us today. — Philosophy and Reason: The Seeds of Scientific Inquiry While myths dominated early cultures, a shift began with the advent of philosophy in ancient Greece around the 6th century BCE. Philosophers like Thales, Pythagoras, and Heraclitus sought to explain the world through reason and observation rather than divine intervention. This marked the birth of natural philosophy—the precursor to modern science. Socrates, Plato, and Aristotle expanded this intellectual revolution. Aristotle, in particular, emphasized systematic observation and categorization of the natural world, laying the groundwork for empirical investigation. Greek curiosity also extended to astronomy, with thinkers like Ptolemy developing complex models to explain the movements of celestial bodies. The curiosity-driven quest for knowledge flourished elsewhere, too. In ancient India, scholars developed advanced mathematics, while Chinese scientists made breakthroughs in medicine, engineering, and astronomy. The Islamic Golden Age (8th-13th centuries CE) became a hub for intellectual exchange, preserving and expanding upon Greek, Indian, and Persian knowledge. Figures like Alhazen and Avicenna made significant contributions to optics and medicine, driven by an insatiable curiosity about how the world worked. — Medieval Europe: Bridging Faith and Curiosity During the European Middle Ages, intellectual curiosity persisted, often within the framework of religious faith. Monasteries became centers of learning, where scholars painstakingly copied ancient texts and sought to reconcile classical knowledge with Christian theology. Thinkers like Thomas Aquinas and Albertus Magnus explored questions about the natural world, blending faith and reason in their inquiries. Meanwhile, curiosity about exploration and trade drove technological advancements. The invention of the magnetic compass and improvements in shipbuilding during this period were fueled by a desire to understand and navigate the wider world. — The Renaissance: A Reawakening of Human Curiosity The Renaissance (14th-17th centuries) marked a dramatic resurgence of curiosity and intellectual inquiry. Inspired by the rediscovery of classical texts, Renaissance scholars embraced a humanistic perspective, celebrating human potential and creativity. Artists like Leonardo da Vinci exemplified the intersection of art and science, sketching detailed studies of anatomy and engineering marvels. This era also witnessed a growing emphasis o...

Justification (epistemology) Article Talk This article needs additional citations for verification . Please help improve this article by adding citations to reliable sources . Unsourced material may be challenged and removed. Find sources: "Justification" epistemology – news · newspapers · books · scholar · JSTOR ( March 2016 ) ( Learn how and when to remove this message ) Justification (also called epistemic justification ) is a property of beliefs that fulfill certain norms about what a person should believe. [ 1 ] [ 2 ] Epistemologists often identify justification as a component of knowledge distinguishing it from mere true opinion. [ 3 ] They study the reasons why someone holds a belief. [ 4 ] Epistemologists are concerned with various features of belief, which include the ideas of warrant (a proper justification for holding a belief), knowledge , rationality , and probability , among others. Debates surrounding epistemic justification often involve the structure of justification, including whether there are foundational justified beliefs or whether mere coherence is sufficient for a system of beliefs to qualify as justified. Another major subject of debate is the sources of justification, which might include perceptual experience (the evidence of the senses), reason , and authoritative testimony , among others. Contents 1 Justification and knowledge 2 Conceptions of justification 3 Theories of justification 4 Criticism of theories of justification 5 See also 6 References 7 External links 7.1 Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy Justification and knowledge edit "Justification" involves the reasons why someone holds a belief that one should hold based on one's current evidence. [ 4 ] Justification is a property of beliefs insofar as they are held blamelessly. In other words, a justified belief is a belief that a person is entitled to hold. Many philosophers from Plato onward have treated " justified true belief " (JTB) as constituting knowledge. It is particularly associated with a theory discussed in his dialogues Meno and Theaetetus . While in fact Plato seems to disavow justified true belief as constituting knowledge at the end of Theaetetus , the claim that Plato unquestioningly accepted this view of knowledge stuck until the proposal of the Gettier problem . [ 4 ] The subject of justification has played a major role in the value of knowledge as "justified true belief". [ citation needed ] Some contemporary epistemologists, such as Jonathan Kvanvig , assert that justification isn't necessary in getting to the truth and avoiding errors. Kvanvig attempts to show that knowledge is no more valuable than true belief, and in the process dismissed the necessity of justification due to justification not being connected to the truth. [ citation needed ] Conceptions of justification edit William P. Alston identifies two conceptions of justification. [ 5 ] : 15–16 One conception is "deontological" justification, which holds that justification evaluates the obligation and responsibility of a person having only true beliefs. This conception implies, for instance, that a person who has made his best effort but is incapable of concluding the correct belief from his evidence is still justified. The deontological conception of justification corresponds to epistemic internalism . Another conception is "truth-conducive" justification, which holds that justification is based on having sufficient evidence or reasons that entails that the belief is at least likely to be true. The truth-conductive conception of justification corresponds to epistemic externalism . Theories of justification edit There are several different views as to what entails justification, mostly focusing on the question "How beliefs are justified?". Different theories of justification require different conditions before a belief can be considered justified. Theories of justification generally include other aspects of epistemology, such as defining knowledge. Notable theor...

*Search query: scientific method and explanation*

Scientific method Article Talk For broader coverage of this topic, see Research and Epistemology . For other uses, see Scientific method (disambiguation) . The scientific method is an empirical method for acquiring knowledge that has been referred to while doing science since at least the 17th century. Historically, it was developed through the centuries from the ancient and medieval world. The scientific method involves careful observation coupled with rigorous skepticism , because cognitive assumptions can distort the interpretation of the observation . Scientific inquiry includes creating a testable hypothesis through inductive reasoning , testing it through experiments and statistical analysis, and adjusting or discarding the hypothesis based on the results. [ 1 ] [ 2 ] [ 3 ] Although procedures vary across fields , the underlying process is often similar. In more detail: the scientific method involves making conjectures (hypothetical explanations), predicting the logical consequences of hypothesis, then carrying out experiments or empirical observations based on those predictions. [ 4 ] A hypothesis is a conjecture based on knowledge obtained while seeking answers to the question. Hypotheses can be very specific or broad but must be falsifiable , implying that it is possible to identify a possible outcome of an experiment or observation that conflicts with predictions deduced from the hypothesis; otherwise, the hypothesis cannot be meaningfully tested. [ 5 ] While the scientific method is often presented as a fixed sequence of steps, it actually represents a set of general principles. Not all steps take place in every scientific inquiry (nor to the same degree), and they are not always in the same order. [ 6 ] [ 7 ] Numerous discoveries have not followed the textbook model of the scientific method and chance has played a role, for instance.

Western Philosophy Duns Scotus’ Proof of God’s Existence: A Philosophical Breakdown October 28, 2023 John Duns Scotus, a medieval philosopher and theologian, is widely known for his intricate contributions to the philosophy of religion, particularly his argument for the existence of God. Scotus’ arguments, though deeply rooted in the intellectual tradition of scholasticism , introduced a distinctive approach to understanding the divine. In this blog, we will break down his proof for God’s existence, focusing on his concepts of essential and accidental series of causes, the necessity of a first efficient cause, and his unique “triple primacy” argument. By exploring Scotus’ philosophy, we can gain a deeper understanding of how he defends the rational necessity of God’s existence in a way that challenges both infinite regress and material causality. Table of Contents Understanding Duns Scotus’ Proof for God’s Existence The Concept of Causes: Essential vs. Accidental Essential Causes Accidental Causes The Problem of Infinite Regress The Necessity of a First Cause The Triple Primacy: Efficient, Final, and Pre-Eminent Cause Efficient Causality: God as the First Efficient Cause Final Causality: God as the Final End Pre-Eminent Causality: God as the Supreme Being Conclusion Understanding Duns Scotus’ Proof for God’s Existence 🔗 Duns Scotus’ proof for God’s existence is a sophisticated blend of metaphysical reasoning and theological argumentation. His approach is grounded in the principles of causality, which form the backbone of his entire cosmological argument . Scotus rejects the idea of an infinite regress of causes, which is a central tenet in many other philosophical traditions, and instead emphasizes the necessity of a “first cause” that itself is uncaused. This leads us to the central question: What is this “first cause,” and how can we understand it philosophically? The Concept of Causes: Essential vs. Accidental 🔗 Before diving into Scotus’ primary arguments, it is crucial to understand two key concepts in his metaphysics: essential causes and accidental causes . These terms relate to how causes are ordered and how they influence the existence of other entities. For Scotus, causes can be classified into two categories based on their relationship to the essence of the effect. Essential Causes 🔗 Essential causes are those that are necessary for the very existence of a thing. Without these causes, the effect could not exist at all. For instance, if we think of a book, the essential cause would be the paper, ink, and the author’s intention that bring the book into being. In Scotus’ view, the essential cause is intrinsic to the effect and necessary for the effect to occur. Accidental Causes 🔗 On the other hand, accidental causes are those that contribute to the existence of a thing but are not essential to it. Using the book example again, the color of the cover or the type of font used would be accidental causes. They can be altered or removed without ceasing to be a book. Accidental causes are contingent —they are not necessary for the existence of the effect but might play a role in its specific manifestation. Scotus uses this distinction to argue for the necessity of a first cause in the universe. He believes that the causal series that leads to the existence of everything in the world cannot be explained solely by accidental causes. There must be something that stands as the essential cause—the “first cause”—that is uncaused and independent of any other conditions. The Problem of Infinite Regress 🔗 One of the most fundamental philosophical problems Scotus addresses in his proof for God’s existence is the idea of infinite regress . Infinite regress refers to the idea that every event or effect must be caused by a prior event or effect, leading to an endless chain of causes stretching back in time. Scotus rejects this notion, arguing that an infinite regress is not metaphysically coherent and cannot adequately explain the exist...

*Search query: Aristotle physics metaphysics elementary principles*

Aristotle divided the theoretical sciences into three groups: physics , mathematics , and theology . Physics as he understood it was equivalent to what would now be called “natural philosophy,” or the study of nature ( physis ); in this sense it encompasses not only the modern field of physics but also biology , chemistry, geology, psychology , and even meteorology. Metaphysics , however, is notably absent from Aristotle’s classification; indeed, he never uses the word, which first appears in the posthumous catalog of his writings as a name for the works listed after the Physics . He does, however, recognize the branch of philosophy now called metaphysics: he calls it “ first philosophy ” and defines it as the discipline that studies “being as being.” Aristotle’s contributions to the physical sciences are less impressive than his researches in the life sciences. In works such as On Generation and Corruption and On the Heavens , he presented a world-picture that included many features inherited from his pre-Socratic predecessors. From Empedocles (c. 490–430 bce ) he adopted the view that the universe is ultimately composed of different combinations of the four fundamental elements of earth, water, air, and fire. Each element is characterized by the possession of a unique pair of the four elementary qualities of heat, cold, wetness, and dryness: earth is cold and dry, water is cold and wet, air is hot and wet, and fire is hot and dry. Each element has a natural place in an ordered cosmos, and each has an innate tendency to move toward this natural place. Thus, earthy solids naturally fall, while fire, unless prevented, rises ever higher. Other motions of the elements are possible but are “violent.” (A relic of Aristotle’s distinction is preserved in the modern-day contrast between natural and violent death.)

As in that work, the Earth is at the centre of the universe, and around it the Moon, the Sun, and the other planets revolve in a succession of concentric crystalline spheres. The heavenly bodies are not compounds of the four terrestrial elements but are made up of a superior fifth element, or “quintessence.” In addition, the heavenly bodies have souls, or supernatural intellects, which guide them in their travels through the cosmos. Even the best of Aristotle’s scientific work has now only a historical interest. The abiding value of treatises such as the Physics lies not in their particular scientific assertions but in their philosophical analyses of some of the concepts that pervade the physics of different eras—concepts such as place, time, causation, and determinism . Place Every body appears to be in some place, and every body (at least in principle) can move from one place to another. The same place can be occupied at different times by differ...

Mesopotamian Creation Myths are ancient narratives that explain the origins of the world, gods, and humanity in Mesopotamia. These myths, originating from Sumeria, Acadia, and Babylon, were recorded on clay tablets and passed down through generations. They depict various versions of the world’s creation, often involving a primordial chaos dividing into sky and earth by a powerful deity. Human origins are also explained, with humans created from divine blood or a mix of divine materials. These myths play a significant role in understanding the complex cosmology and religious beliefs of ancient Mesopotamian civilizations. Content of this Article Toggle Are you brave enough to face the gods? Find out here! Overview of Mesopotamian Religion Mesopotamian religion was characterized by a rich pantheon of deities and a complex system of beliefs and rituals. The ancient Mesopotamians worshipped a multitude of gods and goddesses, each with their own specific roles and powers. The pantheon included deities such as Anu , Enlil , Ninhursag , Inanna, and Marduk , among many others. These gods were believed to have control over various aspects of life, including nature, fertility, war, and justice. Mesopotamian Deities and Pantheon The Mesopotamian pantheon consisted of different gods and goddesses, each associated with specific domains and worshiped in temples throughout the region. Anu , the sky god, was regarded as the highest deity and the father of the gods. Enlil , the god of wind and storms, was considered the king of the gods and the ruler of the earth. Ninhursag , also known as the mother goddess, was associated with fertility and childbirth. Inanna, the goddess of love and war, was one of the most revered deities in Mesopotamia. Marduk , the patron god of Babylon, gained prominence in later periods and became the supreme deity. Functions and Powers of Gods in Mesopotamian Mythology In Mesopotamian mythology , the gods were believed to play vital roles in shaping the universe and determining the course of human events. Each deity had specific functions and powers attributed to them. For example, Enlil was responsible for maintaining order and justice, while Inanna governed matters of love, war, and fertility. Marduk , in addition to being the creator of the world in some myths, also held dominion over civilization, agriculture, and the arts.

Sumerian Creation Myth The Sumerian Creation Myth is among the earliest recorded narratives of Mesopotamian mythology . It presents a unique perspective on the origins of the world and introduces significant deities in Sumerian cosmology. This section explores two key aspects of the Sumerian Creation Myth: The Enuma Elish, known as the Babylonian Creation Epic, and the epic battle between Marduk and Tiamat . The Enuma Elish: Creation Epic of Babylon The Enuma Elish, a prominent ancient Babylonian poem, provides a detailed account of the creation of the world and the establishment of divine order. It describes a primordial chaos and the emergence of the gods, with Marduk , the patron deity of Babylon, playing a central role in shaping the cosmos. The Enuma Elish reveals the power dynamics among the gods and narrates Marduk ’s ultimate triumph over the primordial goddess Tiamat . Marduk and Tiamat : Battle for Creation The conflict between Marduk and Tiamat serves as a central theme in the Sumerian Creation Myth. Tiamat , personifying chaos in the form of a monstrous dragon, poses a threat to the younger gods. Marduk rises to the challenge and engages in an epic battle against Tiamat , ultimately vanquishing her and using her remains to create the world. This myth illustrates the triumph of order over chaos and establishes Marduk ’s role as the...

Jump to content From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia It has been suggested that this article be split into multiple articles. ( Discuss ) ( January 2025 ) Illustration of Kepler's laws with two planetary orbits. The orbits are ellipses, with foci F 1 and F 2 for Planet 1, and F 1 and F 3 for Planet 2. The Sun is at F 1 . The shaded areas A 1 and A 2 are equal, and are swept out in equal times by Planet 1's orbit. The ratio of Planet 1's orbit time to Planet 2's is ( a 1 / a 2 ) 3 / 2 {\textstyle ({a_{1}}/{a_{2}})^{3/2}} .

These laws replaced circular orbits and epicycles in the heliocentric theory of Nicolaus Copernicus with elliptical orbits and explained how planetary velocities vary. The three laws state that: [ 1 ] [ 2 ] The orbit of a planet is an ellipse with the Sun at one of the two foci . A line segment joining a planet and the Sun sweeps out equal areas during equal intervals of time. The square of a planet's orbital period is proportional to the cube of the length of the semi-major axis of its orbit. The elliptical orbits of planets were indicated by calculations of the orbit of Mars . From this, Kepler inferred that other bodies in the Solar System , including those farther away from the Sun, also have elliptical orbits. The second law establishes that when a planet is closer to the Sun, it travels faster. The third law expresses that the farther a planet is from the Sun, the longer its orbital period. Isaac Newton showed in 1687 that relationships like Kepler's would apply in the Solar System as a consequence of his own laws of motion and law of universal gravitation . A more precise historical approach is found in Astronomia nova and Epitome Astronomiae Copernicanae . Comparison to Copernicus [ edit ] Johannes Kepler 's laws improved the model of Copernicus . According to Copernicus: [ 3 ] [ 4 ] The planetary orbit is a circle with epicycles. The Sun is approximately at the center of the orbit. The speed of the planet in the main orbit is constant. Despite being correct in saying that the planets revolved around the Sun, Copernicus was incorrect in defining their orbits. Introducing physical explanations for movement in space beyond just geometry, Kepler correctly defined the orbit of planets as follows: [ 1 ] [ 2 ] [ 5 ] : 53–54 The planetary orbit is not a circle with epicycles, but an ellipse . The Sun is not at the center but at a focal point of the elliptical orbit. Neither the linear speed nor the angular speed of the planet in the orbit is constant, but the area speed (closely linked historically with the concept of angular momentum ) is constant. The eccentricity of the orbit of the Earth makes the time from the March equinox to the September equinox , around 186 days, unequal to the time from the September equinox to the March equinox, around 1...

*Search query: Occam's Razor falsifiability parsimony scientific theories justification*

Jump to content From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia Philosophical problem-solving principle For other uses, see Occam's Razor (disambiguation) . In philosophy , Occam's razor (also spelled Ockham's razor or Ocham's razor ; Latin : novacula Occami ) is the problem-solving principle that recommends searching for explanations constructed with the smallest possible set of elements. It is also known as the principle of parsimony or the law of parsimony ( Latin : lex parsimoniae ). Attributed to William of Ockham , a 14th-century English philosopher and theologian , it is frequently cited as Entia non sunt multiplicanda praeter necessitatem , which translates as "Entities must not be multiplied beyond necessity", [ 1 ] [ 2 ] although Occam never used these exact words. Popularly, the principle is sometimes paraphrased as "of two competing theories, the simpler explanation of an entity is to be preferred." [ 3 ] This philosophical razor advocates that when presented with competing hypotheses about the same prediction and both hypotheses have equal explanatory power, one should prefer the hypothesis that requires the fewest assumptions, [ 4 ] and that this is not meant to be a way of choosing between hypotheses that make different predictions. Similarly, in science, Occam's razor is used as an abductive heuristic in the development of theoretical models rather than as a rigorous arbiter between candidate models. [ 5 ] [ 6 ] History [ edit ] The phrase Occam's razor did not appear until a few centuries after William of Ockham's death in 1347. Libert Froidmont , in his 1649 Philosophia Christiana de Anima ( On Christian Philosophy of the Soul ), gives him credit for the phrase, speaking of " novacula occami ". [ 7 ] Ockham did not invent this principle, but its fame—and its association with him—may be due to the frequency and effectiveness with which he used it. [ 8 ] Ockham stated the principle in various ways, but the most popular version, "Entities are not to be multiplied without necessity" ( Non sunt multiplicanda entia sine necessitate ) was formulated by the Irish Franciscan philosopher John Punch in his 1639 commentary on the works of Duns Scotus . [ 9 ] Formulations before William of Ockham [ edit ] Part of a page from John Duns Scotus 's book Commentaria oxoniensia ad IV libros magistri Sententiarus , showing the words: " Pluralitas non est ponenda sine necessitate ", i.e., "Plurality is not to be posited without necessity" The origins of what has come to be known as Occam's razor are traceable to the works of earlier philosophers such as John Duns Scotus (1265–1308), Robert Grosseteste (1175–1253), Maimonides (Moses ben-Maimon, 1138–1204), and even Aristotle (384–322 BC). [ 10 ] [ 11 ] Aristotle writes in his Posterior Analytics , "We may assume the superiority ceteris paribus [other things being equal] of the demonstration which derives from fewer postulates or hypotheses." Ptolemy ( c. AD 90 – c. 168 ) stated, "We consider it a good principle to explain the phenomena by the simplest hypothesis possible." [ 12 ] Phrases such as "It is vain to do with more what can be done with fewer" and "A plurality is not to be posited without necessity" were commonplace in 13th-century scholastic writing. [ 12 ] Robert Grosseteste, in Commentary on [Aristotle's] the Posterior Analytics Books ( Commentarius in Posteriorum Analyticorum Libros ) ( c. 1217–1220 ), declares: "That is better and more valuable which requires fewer, other circumstances being equal... For if one thing were demonstrated from many and another thing from fewer equally known premises, clearly that is better which is from fewer because it makes us know quickly, just as a universal demonstration is better than particular because it produces knowledge from fewer premises. Similarly in natural science, in moral science, and in metaphysics the best is that which needs no premises and the better that which needs the fewer, other circumstances being equal." [ 13 ] The Summ...

### Research Analysis (Cycle 2)

This cycle has primarily reinforced existing understandings and provided new depth in specific areas. The search results regarding Aristotle’s physics and metaphysics revealed a clearer understanding of his classification of sciences and the pre-Socratic influences on his cosmology. The Kepler results firmly establish the laws of planetary motion as a foundational element of understanding nature mathematically. Results about Occam’s Razor have clarified its application and original context.  A new thread emerges – the distinction between theorists and experimentalists, which is important for the relationship between different disciplines and also to explain why some of the early work was not up to modern scientific standards. The impact of computational modeling on scientific reasoning is a logical extension of 'The role of mathematical models in prediction,' suggesting a broader look at how computers are shaping scientific inquiry and validation processes. Results on Mesopotamian cosmologies are largely mythological and do not serve the overarching investigation of scientific reasoning. Similarly, Egyptian cosmology is less relevant to our core focus. Further exploration is needed for 'The Role of Testimony and Authority' as well as understanding the interplay between philosophical and scientific justifications.

Review Home › Reviews › Aristotle on Teleology Teleology pervades Aristotle's philosophy, perhaps like no other notion. Its applications range from elemental theory and chemistry, to psychology, biology, astronomy, ethics and politics. Surveying the uses of teleology throughout his philosophy can thus serve as a good introduction to Aristotle's overall philosophy. Monte Ransome Johnson's study provides such a survey, and in the process gives us an in-depth analysis of Aristotelian teleology, its nature and its limitations. Johnson's own general view of Aristotle's teleology is this: 'Aristotle thinks that the fact that things function well in nature needs a general explanation. But the explanations he offers invariably make reference to specific natural substances. He is wary of attempts to generalize about a generic, overall good, which he holds has little or no explanatory power … His teleological explanations in the works on nature make reference to the good of specific kinds of things -- stars, elements, plants, animals, humans, families, and cities -- and not just to human beings, god, or some other overarching cosmic good' (11). Accordingly, much of the book is devoted to clearing away what Johnson takes to be misunderstandings of Aristotelian teleology. So Aristotle's teleology of living creatures is 'not anthropomorphic, not committed to backwards causation, and not a mere heuristic for materialist and mechanistic explanations' (188). On these points I think Johnson is entirely successful. However, Johnson also wants to show that Aristotle's teleology is neither anthropocentric nor cosmic, and on these points I shall suggest some ways in which his arguments may be challenged. The work falls in two parts. The first, 'Teleology as a Critical Explanatory Framework', contains an excellent historical survey of the interpretations of Aristotle's teleology -- I found the demonstration of Kant's influence on Aristotelian scholarship particularly valuable -- an outline of the theory of the four causes, the final cause in particular, and an account of the dialectic between Aristotle's teleology and the explanatory theories of Aristotle's predecessors and contemporaries. The discussion in this part cruises along nicely until it hits choppy waters in the final section on Plato. The problem arises from Johnson's defence of Aristotle's claim in Metaphysics I.6 that Plato only used the formal and the material causes, and so not the final cause. Aristotle's claim seems to fly in the face of passages in the Phaedo , Philebus , Laws and Timaeus , where Plato indicates how one might or should explain something by reference to its end. Johnson's explanation of why Aristotle is nonetheless right about Plato is this: It is because of Plato's prioritization of art over nature, and his specification of the cause for the sake of which with reference to the whole universe, and not with reference to its individuals or natural kinds, means that he did not employ the notion of the for the sake of which as a cause -- i.e. in a causal explanation. He specifies no end for the technology, nor indicates a real beneficiary. (127) It is worth dwelling a little on some problems with this explanation since it helps bring out some distinctive features of Johnson's understanding of teleology. First of all, it cannot be right, even for Aristotle, to say that if one explains the cosmos as the creation of art then one cannot also explain it as created for the sake of something. One might think that Aristotle's use of what Johnson calls the 'art model' in texts such as Physics II.8 199a8-20 is exactly meant to show how nature displays final causation even more than art, an argument that works only because it is already accepted that art does work for the sake of an end. Johnson counters by distinguishing a model which provides a 'heuristic' for thinking about causality from a 'theoretical discussion' of causality. According to Johnson, Plato provides the former...

*Search query: inductive reasoning experimental design Bacon Baconian method*

Jump to content From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia Investigative process Portrait of Francis Bacon The Baconian method is the investigative method developed by Francis Bacon , one of the founders of modern science, and thus a first formulation of a modern scientific method . The method was put forward in Bacon's book Novum Organum (1620), or 'New Method', to replace the old methods put forward in Aristotle 's Organon . It influenced the early modern rejection of medieval Aristotelianism . Description in the Novum Organum [ edit ] Main article: Novum Organum Bacon's view of induction [ edit ] Bacon's method is an example of the application of inductive reasoning . However, Bacon's method of induction is much more complex than the essential inductive process of making generalisations from observations. Bacon's method begins with description of the requirements for making the careful, systematic observations necessary to produce quality facts. He then proceeds to use induction, the ability to generalise from a set of facts to one or more axioms. However, he stresses the necessity of not generalising beyond what the facts truly demonstrate. The next step may be to gather additional data, or the researcher may use existing data and the new axioms to establish additional axioms. Specific types of facts can be particularly useful, such as negative instances, exceptional instances and data from experiments. The whole process is repeated in a stepwise fashion to build an increasingly complex base of knowledge, but one which is always supported by observed facts, or more generally speaking, empirical data. He argues in the Novum Organum that our only hope for building true knowledge is through this careful method. Old knowledge-building methods were often not based in facts, but on broad, ill-proven deductions and metaphysical conjecture. Even when theories were based in fact, they were often broad generalisations and/or abstractions from few instances of casually gathered observations. Using Bacon's process, man could start fresh, setting aside old superstitions, over-generalisations, and traditional (often unproven) "facts". Researchers could slowly but accurately build an essential base of knowledge from the ground up. Describing then-existing knowledge, Bacon claims: There is the same degree of licentiousness and error in forming axioms as [there is] in abstracting notions, and [also] in the first principles, which depend in common induction [versus Bacon's induction]; still more is this the case in axioms and inferior propositions derived from syllogisms . [ 1 ] While he advocated a very empirical, observational, reasoned method that did away with metaphysical conjecture, Bacon was a religious man, believed in God, and believed his work had a religious role. He contended, like other researchers at the time, that by doing this careful work man could begin to understand God's wonderful creation, to reclaim the knowledge that had been lost in Adam and Eve's "fall", and to make the most of his God-given talents. Role of the English Reformation [ edit ] There is a wider array of seminal works about the interaction of Puritanism and early science. Among others, Dorothy Stimson , [ citation needed ] Richard Foster Jones , [ citation needed ] and Robert Merton saw Puritanism as a major driver of the reforms initiated by Bacon and the development of science overall. [ 2 ] Steven Matthews is cautious about the interaction with a single confession, as the English Reformation allowed a higher doctrinal diversity compared to the continent. [ 3 ] However, Matthews is quite outspoken that "Bacon's entire understanding of what we call 'science,' and what he called 'natural philosophy,' was fashioned around the basic tenets of his belief system." [ 4 ] Approach to causality [ edit ] The method consists of procedures for isolating and further investigating the form nature , or cause, of a phenomenon , including the method of agreement, method of...

*Search query: Popper falsifiability scientific certainty limits knowledge*

Skip to content Karl Popper’s theory of falsification contends that scientific inquiry should aim not to verify hypotheses but to rigorously test and identify conditions under which they are false. For a theory to be valid according to falsification, it must produce hypotheses that have the potential to be proven incorrect by observable evidence or experimental results. Unlike verification, falsification focuses on categorically disproving theoretical predictions rather than confirming them. Summary Karl Popper believed that scientific knowledge is provisional – the best we can do at the moment. Popper is known for his attempt to refute the classical positivist account of the scientific method by replacing induction with the falsification principle. The Falsification Principle, proposed by Karl Popper, is a way of demarcating science from non-science. It suggests that for a theory to be considered scientific, it must be able to be tested and conceivably proven false. For example, the hypothesis that “all swans are white” can be falsified by observing a black swan. For Popper, science should attempt to disprove a theory rather than attempt to continually support theoretical hypotheses. Theory of Falsification Karl Popper is prescriptive and describes what science should do (not how it actually behaves). Popper is a rationalist and contended that the central question in the philosophy of science was distinguishing science from non-science. Karl Popper, in ‘The Logic of Scientific Discovery’ emerged as a major critic of inductivism, which he saw as an essentially old-fashioned strategy. Popper replaced the classical observationalist-inductivist account of the scientific method with falsification (i.e., deductive logic) as the criterion for distinguishing scientific theory from non-science. Inductive reasoning involves drawing general conclusions based on specific observations or patterns, moving from specific instances to broader generalizations. In science, deductive reasoning tests or verifies these hypotheses by deriving specific predictions or expectations that can be tested through experimentation or further observation. All inductive evidence is limited: we do not observe the universe at all times and in all places. We are not justified, therefore, in making a general rule from this observation of particulars. According to Popper, scientific theory should make predictions that can be tested, and the theory should be rejected if these predictions are shown not to be correct. He argued that science would best progress using deductive reasoning as its primary emphasis, known as critical rationalism. Popper gives the following example: Europeans, for thousands of years had observed millions of white swans. Using inductive evidence, we could come up with the theory that all swans are white. However, exploration of Australasia introduced Europeans to black swans. Poppers’ point is this: no matter how many observations are made which confirm a theory, there is always the possibility that a future observation could refute it. Induction cannot yield certainty. Karl Popper was also critical of the naive empiricist view that we objectively observe the world. Popper argued that all observation is from a point of view, and indeed that all observation is colored by our understanding. The world appears to us in the context of theories we already hold: it is ‘theory-laden.’ Popper proposed an alternative scientific method based on falsification. However, many confirming instances exist for a theory; it only takes one counter-observation to falsify it. Science progresses when a theory is shown to be wrong and a new theory is introduced that better explains the phenomena. For Popper, the scientist should attempt to disprove his/her theory rather than attempt to prove it continually. Popper does think that science can help us progressively approach the truth, but we can never be certain that we have the final explanation. Critical Evaluation...

Summer 2013 Edition © Metaphysics Research Lab , CSLI , Stanford University This is a file in the archives of the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy . Author & Citation Info | Friends PDF Preview | InPho Search | PhilPapers Bibliography Epistemological Problems of Testimony First published Thu Feb 2, 2006; substantive revision Mon Aug 27, 2012 Given that speakers of a language sometimes assert falsehoods and
fail to be sincere, under what conditions, if any, is someone's
word alone sufficient to justify the beliefs a hearer acquires from
those assertions? Of course, besides the word of the speaker, hearers
also causally depend in believing testimony on other fundamental
sources of knowledge like perception, memory, learning, and inference.
Can the reliability of testimony be justified by appeal to these
sources? This question represents the dominant epistemological problem
of testimony—is testimony an autonomous source of epistemic
authority? Reductionists answer negatively. They are opposed
by anti-reductionists who hold, characteristically on a
priori grounds, that testimony is a source of warrant in itself,
not reducible to warrant derived from these other sources, even if
empirically dependent on them. 1. The Nature of Testimony and its Epistemological Vulnerability The primary speech-act of testimony is a speaker's saying,
telling, or asserting something (Searle 1969). Assertion puts forth a
proposition that the speaker represents as true (see the entry on assertion , on norms of assertion, Rescorla 2009): The utterance of a sentence serves not only to express a thought,
and to refer to a truth-value, but also to assert something, namely
that the thought expressed is true, or that the truth-value referred to
is truth. (Dummett 1981, 298) Standard assertions are not epistemically qualified or
‘guarded’ e.g., I am pretty (very) sure that p ,
but the expression of the corresponding all-out (or full) belief (see
Toulmin 1958, 85; also, Coady 1992; Fricker 1995, 2004; Graham 1997;
Goldberg 2001; Lackey 2008, especially Ch.1; Cullison 2010). In assertion, the speaker extends an invitation to the hearer
(to understand him) e.g., Thomson (1990). To use Kant's example:
If I start to pack my suitcase in front of you, but I have no plan to
leave then I intentionally deceive you by giving you evidence that I
plan to leave. But I do not invite you to notice or to understand what
I am doing. By contrast, if I said to you either “I am leaving
town” (a lie) or “Don't worry if you do not find me
here tomorrow” (an intentionally misleading assertion), I do
invite you to understand and believe me. Thereby, I assume
responsibility for the truth and veracity of my assertion, though
arguably less so for the implicature that “I am leaving
town,” see Adler (1997). Discussion is restricted to cases in which the speaker's
utterance is meant literally, rather than rhetorically, playfully,
figuratively, fictionally, or ironically. These restrictions are
imposed for brevity, though the discussion is oriented to the primacy
of literal usage and informativeness (see, e.g., Bach and Harnish
1979; McDowell 1980). The primacy of the aim of informativeness
explains why the untruths of tact and related forms of social
politeness should be set aside. The norm of truthfulness is relaxed.
The relaxation is, presumably, a product of tacit consent and
coordination for purposes of sociability and social harmony. Vagueness
and ‘loose talk’ e.g., “The meeting is around 3
pm” are pervasive and essential for at least economy and ease of
comprehension, but they are not treated separately (Bach 2001). Since we are in great need of information from others, we will not be
so demanding that in order to avoid error, we refuse to take any risks
of misinformation to gain valuable truths. Gelfert (2006) presents Kant
as arguing that we have a presumptive (imperfect) duty not to distrust
others and a duty of fidelity to trust t...

### Research Analysis (Cycle 3)

This cycle’s search results have deepened our understanding of several areas, most notably around the role of authority and justification in early science. The focus on Johnson's study of Aristotle’s teleology revealed the problematic implications of an anthropocentric justification. Popper’s work and the introduction of falsifiability has introduced a significant paradigm shift in scientific methodology. The previous focus on purely empirical methods appears insufficient and a more robust methodology involving falsifiability and recognizing the limitations of testimony is needed. Further exploration is warranted into the nuances of testing theories, considering the interplay of empirical data, logic, and philosophical underpinnings. We're moving towards a deeper appreciation for the sociological influences shaping scientific thought.

165 GENUS  AND DIFFERENCE  IN AVICENNA. JON MCGINNIS
Logic and Science : The Role of Genus and Difference in
Avicenna’s Logic, Science and Natural Philosophy*
What is the relation between logic and science ? One answer that comes to
mind is that logic provides a language, or perhaps better a syntax, for
modeling scientific discourse. Avicenna himself seems to have believed asmuch, when he writes, « The relation of this field of study [i.e., logic] to innerreflection, which is called ‘internal reasoning’ is like the relation of grammarto the explicit interpretation, which is called ‘external reasoning’, and like therelation of prosody to the poem »
1. In this respect, Avicenna notes, logic is a
tool ( °la) that guarantees a certain precision in scientific reasoning and even
safeguards science against the introduction of hidden assumptions andformal fallacies. There is a deeper question, however, concerning the relationbetween logic and science as well : What is the relation between the objects oflogic, namely, the universal predicables, which at least for Avicenna arepurely mental objects, and the objects of science, namely, the things in the
world and their causal interactions, which for Avicenna are purely extra-. mental objects ?
2 In other words, what is it that ensures that objects that exist
only in the mental world map onto objects that exist only in the externalworld ? What bridges the gap between these two worlds ? Avicenna is ascientific realist inasmuch as for him the goal of science is ultimately a typeof necessary certainty about the way the world is
3. Thus, if one cannot be

2 Superficially this question appears to be the problem of the external world and the issue
of whether it is even possible to have knowledge of the external world ; for if what is immediately
known to us is only mental objects, what justification is there that extra-mental objects
correspond with our mental objects, or even more strongly, what justifies that there is anything
except the mental ? In general, Avicenna seems to have very little patience for skeptical
questions such as this one. For Avicenna we simply do have knowledge of the external world.
Thus the important question for Avicenna is not whether knowledge of the external world is
possible, but what is the explanation of the fact that we do have knowledge of the external world.
3 Although ideally for Avicenna the necessary certainty is absolute necessary certainty, he
also allows, and counts as genuinely scientific, conditional necessary certainty. See J. M CGINNIS ,
Scientific Methodologies in Medieval Islam : Induction and Experimentation in the Philosophy of
Page 2:. 166 JON MCGINNIS
certain that the objects of logic and the conclusions derived from logic
actually capture the way the world really is, then logic, for all the precision inreasoning it might bring, would fail to be an adequate tool for doing science,
at least to Avicenna’s mind. If logic is to play a role in the scientific enterprise,
as Avicenna believes that it does, then there must be some bridge, or commonelement, linking the universal predicables treated in logic with the concreteparticulars that make up the world that the sciences attempt to explain.
Michael Marmura in two articles — « Avicenna’s Chapter on Universals in. the Isagoge  of his
Shif°Õ ˚»4 and « Quiddity and Universality in Avicenna »5 —
has done much to provide a foundation for explaining how Avicenna thought
that the notion of the quiddity or essence in itself could function as the bridgeor common element shared by both universal predicables and concreteparticulars. His analyses are b...

Pages Home About Moderation Station data Homogenization Tuesday, 4 March 2014 Falsifiable and falsification in science "You keep using that word. I do not think it means what you think it means." In a recent post, Interesting what the interesting Judith Curry finds interesting , I stated that "it is very easy to falsify the theory of global warming by greenhouse gasses." The ensuing discussions suggest that it could be interesting to write a little more about the role of falsifiable hypotheses and falsification in science. The main problem is that people confuse falsifiable and falsification , often do not even seem to notice there is a difference, whereas they have very different roles in science. The power of science and falsification are beautifully illustrated in this video by asking normal people on the street to discover the rule behind a number sequence ( h/t U Know I Speak Sense ). Falsifiable Karl Popper only asked himself what distinguishes a scientific hypothesis from an ordinary idea . Popper's beautiful thesis was that you can distinguish between a scientific and a non-scientific statement by asking oneself if it can be falsified . If it cannot, it is not science. Thus the worst one can say about an idea that is supposed to be scientific is that it is not even wrong . Important side remark: Please, note that also non-scientific ideas can be valuable, Popper's philosophy itself is not science, just like most philosophy, political ideas, literature and religion. And please note that wrong hypotheses are also scientific statements; that they are wrong automatically shows that they can be falsified. Even falsified hypothesis are still scientific hypothesis and can even still be useful. An good example would be classical mechanics. This illustrates that Popper did not think about whether hypothesis were right or wrong (falsified), useful or not, but whether a statement is scientific or not scientific. To be falsifiable, falsification is only needed to be possible in principle. It does not matter whether falsification would be hard or easy for the question whether it is science. This is because the main value of the criterion is that it forces you to write up very clearly, very precisely what you are thinking . That allows other scientists to repeat your work, test the idea and build upon it. It is not about falsification, but about clarity. That also implies that the daily job of a scientist is not to falsify hypothesis, especially not solid and well-validated ones. Scientists are also not writing down new falsifiable hypothesis most of the time, in fact they rarely do so. Those are the rare Eukeka moments. The terms scientist and science are clearly much broader and also much harder to capture. The ambitious William M. Connolley set out to define science and what a scientist does in a recent post. Definitely worth reading, especially if you are not that familiar with science. Disclaimer: not surprisingly, the aim was not completely achieved. Psycho analysis A classical example for Popper of a non-scientific hypothesis would be Freud's psycho-analysis. The relationship between the current psychological problems of a patient and what happened long ago in the patients childhood is too flexible and not sufficiently well defined to be science. That does not mean that what happens to a child is not important, there are many modern findings that point into that direction (Joachim Bauer, 2010). If someone else would succeed in making Freud's ideas more specific and falsifiable, it would even be a valuable contribution to science. It also does not mean that psycho-analysis does not help patients. Finally, it also does not mean that it is wrong, rather it means that it is not even wrong. It is too vague. Morphic fields Another example is the idea of Rupert Sheldrake about morphic fields . Sheldrake claims that when an idea has been invented before, it becomes easier to reinvent it. He has a large number of suggestive examples w...

3.1  Introduct Ion
The goal of a trial, of course, is to find the truth about disputed questions. It is not
unlike science which aims to find the truth about questions regarding the physical
and natural world. When the answer to a legal question depends on science, then one might expect the law to provide a warm welcome to the scientific evidence that helps answer the legal question. But it turns out to be more complicated than that.
Scientific evidence features in many legal disputes. The
criminal law often engages various forensic disciplines and recently algorithms that promise scientific predictions about “dangerousness.” Judges are being asked to make crucial decisions such as granting bail and, if so, with what conditions using these algorithms. Criticisms of them raise equal protection and other important issues. Tort cases and medical malpractice cases often turn on questions relating to scientific evidence about substances or procedures. And courts review administrative agency determinations which often involve adjudicating scientific evidence. But judges are not usually scientists, nor even fluent in the scientific method much less the specific scientific disciplines that might be critical in litigation. And to complicate it further, the disciplines have conflicting methodology, vocabulary, and norms. Law puts a high price on certainty and finality. Science, on the other hand, is comfortable with uncertainty and with open questions. This tension permeates the law/science relationship.
As a result, a judge’s job as the gatekeeper of scientific evidence can be a hard one.. There is an
inherent tension between law and science based on uncertainty.

3.2  opinion  evidence : the gener Al rule
The general rule governing opinion evidence in court is familiar to judges: a witness
should testify only about the facts she observed and should not give her opinion about those facts. The rule has a truth-seeking foundation; opinion evidence does not assist a jury or judge and might mislead it. A witness’s subjective opinion about an issue in a case is irrelevant. It is for the jury or judge to draw subjective conclusions from the facts, and a witness’s opinion interferes with that function. The judge, as gate-keeper, is trained to exclude opinion evidence from lay witnesses, so that the fact-finder can draw its own conclusions about the evidence.

This particular gatekeeping function is more nuanced with scientific evidence. The
exception to the general rule barring opinion testimony is for expert opinions. And
expert opinion is commonly how scientific evidence is introduced in litigation.
Expert scientific opinion evidence generally is admissible when a witness’s
education, training, skill, or experience gives expertise and specialized knowledge in a particular subject beyond that of the average person. The expert’s opinion is admissible to assist the fact-finder. Expert witnesses also may testify about facts within their field of expertise. An expert’s opinion must be based on admissible evidence. The expert is expected to give the factfinder the evidentiary basis for her opinion so that the factfinder can form an independent judgment about the expert’s opinion.
There are jurisdiction-specific rules which govern what scientific opinion evidence
can make its way into a proceeding and how so. In the federal system and in many states, understanding the legal architecture around the admission of scientific opinion evidence requires understanding Daubert v. Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals,

Abductive reasoning Article Talk "Abductive" redirects here. For other uses, see Abduction (disambiguation) . Abductive reasoning (also called abduction , [ 1 ] abductive inference , [ 1 ] or retroduction [ 2 ] ) is a form of logical inference that seeks the simplest and most likely conclusion from a set of observations. It was formulated and advanced by American philosopher and logician Charles Sanders Peirce beginning in the latter half of the 19th century. A Mastermind player uses abduction to infer the secret colors (top) from summaries (bottom left) of discrepancies in their guesses (bottom right) . Abductive reasoning, unlike deductive reasoning , yields a plausible conclusion but does not definitively verify it. Abductive conclusions do not eliminate uncertainty or doubt, which is expressed in terms such as "best available" or "most likely". While inductive reasoning draws general conclusions that apply to many situations, abductive conclusions are confined to the particular observations in question. In the 1990s, as computing power grew, the fields of law, [ 3 ] computer science , and artificial intelligence research [ 4 ] spurred renewed interest in the subject of abduction.

For example, if it is given that 95% percent of the elephants are gray, and Louise is an elephant, one can induce that Louise is gray. Still, this is not necessarily the case: 5 percent of the time this conclusion will be wrong. [ 7 ] However, an inference being derived from statistical data is not sufficient to classify it as inductive. For example, if all swans that a person has observed so far are white, they may instead abduce the possibility that all swans are white. They have good reason to believe the conclusion from the premise because it is the best explanation for their observations, and the truth of the conclusion is still not guaranteed. (Indeed, it turns...

### Research Analysis (Cycle 4)

This cycle's results significantly reinforce the need to incorporate abduction, as defined by Peirce, into our understanding of hypothesis formation. While previous cycles focused on deduction and induction, abduction offers a crucial third component in generating testable explanations. The new search results on Peirce highlight the importance of inference to the best explanation, a concept highly relevant to early scientific reasoning where observations often lacked sufficient data for strict inductive or deductive reasoning. Additionally, the focus on falsifiability from previous cycles needs re-evaluation. While crucial, this is not a sufficient condition for scientific justification, as the search results show that a false hypothesis can still prove useful. This cycle’s findings suggest a more nuanced view of theory refinement and revision is needed, focusing not just on falsification, but on overall explanatory power and coherence. Results point towards formalizing this process to improve overall scientific validity.

*Search query: Peirce abduction hypothesis generation scientific reasoning*

Eight to Late Sensemaking and Analytics for Organizations Peirce, Holmes and a gold chain – an essay on abductive reasoning with 10 comments “ It has long been an axiom of mine that the little things are infinitely the most important .” – Sir Arthur Conan Doyle (A Case of Identity) The scientific method is a systematic approach to acquiring and establishing knowledge about how the world works. A scientific investigation typically starts with the formulation of a hypothesis – an educated, evidence-based guess about the mechanism behind the phenomenon being studied – and proceeds by testing how well the hypothesis holds up against experiments designed to disconfirm it. Although many philosophers have waxed eloquent about the scientific method, very few of them have talked about the process of hypothesis generation . Indeed, most scientists will recognise a good hypothesis when they stumble upon one, but they usually will not be able to say how they came upon it. Hypothesis generation is essentially a creative act that requires a deep familiarity with the phenomenon in question and a spark of intuition. The latter is absolutely essential, a point captured eloquently in the following lines attributed to Einstein: “…[Man] makes this cosmos and its construction the pivot of his emotional life in order to find in this way the peace and serenity which he cannot find in the narrow whirlpool of personal experience. The supreme task is to arrive at those universal elementary laws from which the cosmos can be built up by pure deduction. There is no logical path to these laws; only intuition, resting on sympathetic understanding of experience can reach them …” – quoted from Zen and The Art of Motorcycle Maintenance by Robert Pirsig. The American philosopher, Charles Peirce , recognised that hypothesis generation involves a special kind of reasoning, one that enables the investigator to zero in on a small set of relevant facts out of an infinity of possibilities. Charles Sanders Peirce " data-medium-file="https://eight2late.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/400px-charles_sanders_peirce.png?w=200" data-large-file="https://eight2late.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/400px-charles_sanders_peirce.png?w=400" class="size-full wp-image-9925" src="https://eight2late.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/400px-charles_sanders_peirce.png?w=700" alt="" srcset="https://eight2late.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/400px-charles_sanders_peirce.png 400w, https://eight2late.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/400px-charles_sanders_peirce.png?w=100&h=150 100w, https://eight2late.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/400px-charles_sanders_peirce.png?w=200&h=300 200w" sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" /> Charles Sanders Peirce As Peirce wrote in one of his papers: “A given object presents an extraordinary combination of characters of which we should like to have an explanation. That there is any explanation of them is a pure assumption; and if there be, it is [a single] fact which explains them; while there are, perhaps, a million other possible ways of explaining them, if they were not all, unfortunately, false. A man is found in the streets of New York stabbed in the back. The chief of police might open a directory and put his finger on any name and guess that that is the name of the murderer. How much would such a guess be worth? But the number of names in the directory does not approach the multitude of possible laws of attraction which could have accounted for Kepler’s law of planetary motion and, in advance of verification by predications of perturbations etc., would have accounted for them to perfection. Newton, you will say, assumed that the law would be a simple one. But what was that but piling guess on guess? Surely vastly more phenomena in nature are complex than simple…” – quoted from this paper by Thomas Sebeok. Peirce coined the term abduction (as opposed to induction or deduction) to refer to the creative...

*Search query: early science explanatory power versus falsifiability limits*

Skip to content Text settings Story text Size Small Standard Large Width * Standard Wide Links Standard Orange * Subscribers only Learn more Minimize to nav A critical issue in the public debates over science is often what the philosophers consider the demarcation question: how do you mark the boundary between the scientific and other fields of inquiry? The standard of falsifiability was a formal method for drawing this boundary, and was heavily advocated by the philosopher Karl Popper. The idea that scientific proposals could always be shown to be wrong remains an important concept in the debate over what defines science. As noted in the introduction to this series, it has also been adopted as part of the formal definition of science used by the US Supreme Court. But there is ongoing debate as to how important falsifiability is in demarcating science from other types of inquiry, and it's unclear whether it actually plays a role in the regular operation of science. As such, I asked those who took the survey (now almost 40 people) the following: Evaluation/falsifiability: Do things typically get falsified, or do they drop out of favor well in advance of conclusive falsifying data? What is the evaluation of competing models based on? Can you describe the general characteristics that people base evaluations on? How big a role do changing interpretations of primary data play in falsification? The following should give you a fairly strong sense of how little the concept has permeated science: despite the clear context provided by the full question, seven responses interpreted falsification in terms of the scientific fraud of manufacturing false data. Beyond that, very few felt that falsification was centrally important in the day-to-day practice of science. Read on for the details . Some aspects of falsification were suggested to be field-specific—a biologist indicated that physics may falsify based on new data, but biologists took an additive approach, typically incorporating new ideas into old theories. To provide an example of this, I'd note that a strict application of Mendel's laws would not allow for linkage or sex-linked inheritance, yet those patterns are now considered part of the umbrella of "Mendelian inheritance." Meanwhile, other types of inheritance, such as imprinting, are recognized as occurring in parallel with Mendelian inheritance. Despite this, Mendel's ideas are not considered falsified. This additive view extends well beyond biology, however. People in a number of fields suggested that data that might be viewed as falsifying a concept simply reveal the limits to which that concept is generally applicable. A geologist phrased this as, "The theory then is rarely just "wrong", instead you're defining the boundaries under which it gives good predictions... Often it's discovered that some models aren't false as much as they are incomplete. " But moving away from the core sciences, the role of falsifiability became unpredictable. In math, there was no such probing the boundaries of applicability: "In mathematics, falsification means that you found a counterexample to the theorem. This is devastating; you do not come back from that." An engineer suggested a similar approach, noting that, "Ideas get falsified often." Meanwhile, the concept of falsification seemed to be completely absent from computer science, where one person claimed, "if you wait three years the theory that just fallen out of favour will almost certainly turn up again with a fancier name and more money attached." What happens to concepts that turn out to be wrong? Clearly, they don't get incorporated into theories in an additive manner. According to most scientists, the writing tends to be on the wall long before data that can definitively show that they are wrong appears. In some cases, definitive data is never generated; the clear flaws in the concept cause people to stop working on it before the definitive experiments can be designed or performed....

*Search query: testimony authority epistemology scientific justification early modern*

Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy Epistemological Problems of Testimony First published Thu Apr 1, 2021 So much of what we know about the world, e.g., history, science,
politics, one another, etc., comes from the testimony of others. But
while testimony is clearly an indispensable source of knowledge,
specifying exactly how it is that we are able to learn from a
speaker’s say-so has proven to be a difficult task. To this end, a lot (but certainly not all) of the interest in the
epistemology of testimony has centered on the following questions: Is testimony a basic source of justification, or can testimonial
justification be reduced to a combination of other epistemic sources,
e.g., perception, memory, and inference? Can testimony generate knowledge, or can it merely transmit
it? When one acquires testimonial justification, is one’s belief
justified by evidence, or by something else, e.g., non-evidential
assurances? Should testimonial justification be understood individualistically
(in the sense that one’s testimonial justification depends
entirely on factors having to do with one’s self), or should it
be understood anti-individualistically (in the sense that one’s
testimonial justification depends at least in part on factors having
to do with the speaker)? How should we understand the difference between expert and novice
testimony? Do groups testify? And if so, how can we learn from a
group’s say-so? What is testimony itself? The aim of this article is to provide an overview of the major debates
surrounding these issues. Before moving on, it is important to note that these are certainly not
the only important questions about testimony. For instance, there is a
growing literature about how failing to give a testifier the credit
they deserve gives rise to a form of epistemic injustice (e.g., M. Fricker
2007). [ 1 ] Moreover, there are many interesting questions about eyewitness
testimony and the law (e.g., Wells & Olson 2003 and Burroughs
& Tollefsen 2016), as well as important questions about the
relationship between testimony and assertion (e.g., Pagin 2007
[2016]). And there are also growing literatures about moral
testimony [ 2 ] and aesthetic
testimony , [ 3 ] e.g., while it is uncontroversial that you can acquire justification
for believing that the taco truck is open by relying on your
friend’s say-so, it is far less clear that you can acquire
justification for believing that eating carne asada is morally wrong
or that the mural on the taco truck is beautiful, solely on the basis
of what your friend tells you. For reasons only having to do with
space, though, this article will focus exclusively on the seven
questions above. 1. Reductionism and Non-Reductionism Consider this scenario: Your friend testifies to you that your
favorite team won last night’s game (= p ). Because you
know that your friend is a highly reliable sports reporter, and
because you have no reason to doubt what she says on this occasion,
you believe what you are told. In this case, your belief that p is clearly justified. Now, contrast that scenario with this one: You run into a stranger
whom you have never met and they tell you that your favorite team won
last night’s game (= p ). Even though you don’t know
if this person often speaks the truth, you also don’t have any
good reason to doubt what they are telling you. Thus, you decide to
believe what you are told. Whether or not your belief that p is
justified in this case is a lot less clear. Thinking about the difference between cases like these helps motivate
the debate about the following question: First Big Question : Is testimony a basic source of
justification, or can testimonial justification be reduced to a
combination of other epistemic sources? Those who defend answers to this question tend to endorse one of three
main positions: Reductionism , Non-Reductionism , and Hybrid Views . 1.1 Reductionism Reductionists maintain that in order to acqui...

Data analysis requires translating higher level questions and hypotheses into computable statistical models.
We present a mixed-methods study aimed at identifying the steps, considerations, and challenges involved
in operationalizing hypotheses into statistical models, a process we refer to as hypothesis formalization . In a
formative content analysis of 50 research papers, we find that researchers highlight decomposing a hypothesis
into sub-hypotheses, selecting proxy variables, and formulating statistical models based on data collection design
as key steps. In a lab study, we find that analysts fixated on implementation and shaped their analyses to fit
familiar approaches, even if sub-optimal. In an analysis of software tools, we find that tools provide inconsistent,
low-level abstractions that may limit the statistical models analysts use to formalize hypotheses. Based on
these observations, we characterize hypothesis formalization as a dual-search process balancing conceptual and
statistical considerations constrained by data and computation and discuss implications for future tools.

Using statistics to answer real-world questions requires four steps: (i) translating high-level, domain-
specific questions and hypotheses into specific statistical questions [ 16]; (ii) identifying statistical
models to answer the statistical questions; (iii) implementing and executing these statistical models,
typically with the help of software tools; and (iv) interpreting the results, considering the domain-
specific questions and applying analytical reasoning.

### Research Analysis (Cycle 5)

Cycle 4 and 5 search results have reinforced the need to more explicitly incorporate the process of hypothesis formalization into our analysis. The previous emphasis on abduction and induction was crucial, but understanding how scientific hypotheses are translated into testable models is equally essential. The discussion about formalization highlights a practical constraint in scientific reasoning, suggesting that the available tools shape the thinking process and potentially limit the types of hypotheses considered. The recognition that falsifiability is not a sufficient condition for scientific justification demands a broadening of focus towards explanatory power and the overall ability of a theory to be useful and coherent. The limitations of falsification as a guiding principle need careful consideration – a focus on utility rather than absolute verifiability/falsifiability may be required in earlier scientific stages. A new focus on software tools and their impact on hypothesis validation and refinement, coupled with a review of previous cycles regarding Peirce and formalism, signals a shift toward appreciating the role of tools on scientific validation and refinement

Alhazen From Physics Book Jump to navigation Jump to search Claimed and Written by Ananth Somasundaram for PHYS2211 Alhazen was an Arab physicist, mathematiician, and astronomer who resided in Basra, Cairo. Alhazen had significant contributions in the fields of optics, astronomy, mathematics, scientific method and visual perception. He is considered to be the first theoretical physicist. Alhazen also was the earliest to discover that a hypothesis has the requirement to be experimented through trailed procedures or mathematical evidence. Alhazen is considered by many to be the father of modern optics. Alhazen Early Life Alhazen was born in 965 CE in Basra, Buyid Emirate and passed away at the age of 75 in 1040 CE in Cairo, Egypt. He was born to an Arab family and moved to Cairo at an early age. When he moved to Cairo, it was under the rule of Fatimid Caliph al-Hakim. Alhazen pitched a hydraulic project to improve regulation of the flooding of the Nile. After pitching the idea, Alhazen realized the impracticality of his plan. There is no concrete proof, but it has been told that the Caliph was upset at Alhazen for the failed plan and placed him under house arrest till the Caliphs death in 1040. During the house arrest, Alhazen wrote his famous Book Of Optics . Contributions Alhazen had significant contributions in the fields of optics, astronomy, mathematics, scientific method and visual perception as mentioned earlier. He made the correlation that the angle of incidence and refraction does not remain constant. He also researched the magnifying power of the lens. Alhazens work significantly impacted other scientists of his time and future. His book of optics debuted many scientific facts which would be used later in the scientific world. Although Alhazen wrote as many as 200 books, as many as 55 have survived. Book Of Optics As mentioned earlier, Alhazen's most significant contribution was the Book of Optics which was created in a span of 10 years with 7 volumes. This book was also translated into Latin at the end of the 12th Centruy. This book influenced Johann Kepler and Leonardo da Vinci. Theory Of Vision Alhazen performed experiments on colors and light, reflections, and optic illusions. He would view the refraction of light rays through transparent mediums such as air and water and would record the laws of refraction. He was noted to be the first person to perform experiments on the dispersion of light into colors. He was noted to be extremely close to discovering the theory of magnifying lenses. This theory was officially created three centuries later. Alhazen was the first scientist to consider horizontal and vertical components of refracted and reflected light rays. Alhazen proposed an intromission theory which said that from all points of a colored body, light and color along every straight line can be produced from that single point. By stating this, Alhazen realized that his theorem had a loop hole: he couldn't explain how a coherent image formed from many independent sources of radiation. Essentially, every point on an object would send rays to every point on the eye. To fix this problem, he stated that only perpendicular rays from the point would be received by the eye. He stated that perpendicular rays are more powerful than oblique rays. He also stated that there was only one perpendicular ray that enters the eye at an point and all the perpendicular rays converge on the center of the eye. Parallel rays are refracted through the eye and perceived as if perpendicular. Johannes Kepler used Alhazen's theory to build off his own theory of retinal imaging which would address the problem of correspondence of points on an object and places in the eye. Alhazen was the first person to experiment and prove that light travels in straight lines and experimented with refraction and reflection. Alhazen also researched the process of sight and the structure of the eye along with image formations in the eye. He went into the deta...

It explains the differences between the first phase of Peirce’s thinking on abduction, in which the logical framework is largely syllogistic, and the mature phase, in which abduction becomes the first step in the three-step process of scientific inquiry. The problems of the validity of abductive reasoning and that of the methodology of abductive reasoning are also briefly discussed.

Review Home › Reviews › Explanation and Teleology in Aristotle's Science of Nature No idea is more synonymous with Aristotle and none more fundamental to Aristotelian philosophy than teleology. So it is quite remarkable that there have been only two full-length monographs in English exclusively devoted to the subject -- Monte Johnson's Aristotle on Teleology (OUP 2005) and now Mariska Leunissen's Explanation and Teleology in Aristotle's Science of Nature . (There is one other monograph in Italian: D. Quarantotto, 2005, Causa finale, sostanza, essenza in Aristotele, Saggi sulla struttura dei processi teleologici naturali e sulla funzione dei telos , Napoli: Bibliopolis.) The strength of Leunissen's book, which sets it apart from other discussions of Aristotle's teleology, is that her interpretation is developed from a careful analysis of Aristotle's actual use of teleological explanations in the biological works, which is where most of the interesting material is to be found. She examines an impressive assortment of textual examples and offers a detailed exposition of their content. The result is a rich account of how Aristotle thinks teleological causation operates in nature and how final causes are to be integrated into a more comprehensive picture of explanation in natural science. Explanation and Teleology in Aristotle's Science of Nature is an important contribution to scholarship on Aristotle's teleology. And while Leunissen's will certainly not be the last word on the subject, her book has added significantly to the debate and must be engaged with by anyone wishing to tackle the subject from this point forward. The main argument of the book is organized around three central ideas. First, Leunissen argues that in order to grasp Aristotle's teleology we need to make a distinction between two types of teleological causation, what she calls "primary" and "secondary" teleology. Second, explanations in natural science often make use of teleological principles (such as "nature does nothing in vain") which, according to Leunissen, function as heuristic devices: they are deployed by the natural scientist to help uncover those causally relevant features that are to be picked out in ultimate explanations. Third, the scientific value of final causes for Aristotle lies in their having explanatory rather than causal priority. Among other things, this has significance for how we understand Aristotle's puzzling remarks about demonstrations through final causes in Posterior Analytics II 11. My review will be devoted to a critical assessment of these three claims. And while I take issue with several aspects of Leunissen's interpretation, overall I found her arguments both illuminating and persuasive. Primary versus Secondary Teleology While Leunissen has something to say about elemental motion and heavenly bodies (see esp. Chapter 5), her central focus is on living things and their parts. This seems justified. For Aristotle twice says living things are substances "most of all" ( Metaphysics 1041b28-31, 1043b19-23), and so we should expect organisms to exhibit teleology in the strictest sense. Leunissen's distinctive contribution to our understanding of Aristotle's natural teleology is her claim that, when it comes to organisms at least, Aristotle distinguishes two patterns of teleological causation: In the first case, it is the presence of a preexisting potential for form that guides the actions of the formal nature and that thereby directs the teleological process of its realization. In the second case, it is the presence of certain material potentials that allows for certain teleological uses (and not for others); the actions of the formal nature in making use of these materials are secondary to the operation of material necessity that produced the materials in the first place. Both processes thus involve the goal-directed action of the formal nature -- which is why both processes qualify as being teleological , but in the first case, t...

Professor of Sociology and Science Studies, University of California, San Diego There is as much modern uneasiness about putting scientists in a position to make ethical decisions as there is about releasing them totally from such responsibilities. On the one hand, many contemporary areas of ethical choice implicate such technical knowledgeability that few but the possessors of relevant expertise can hope competently to address the issues involved, while, on the other, it is not now supposed that those who have expert knowledge are ethically privileged or more likely to make virtuous decisions than anybody else in our society. In dominant sensibilities, to know more than other people about human respiration is quite a different capacity than knowing when it is right to turn off the respirator. That, indeed, is a way of stating the problem. If these sensibilities did not obtain, then there would be widespread contentment that doctors should disconnect life-support systems and molecular biologists should determine the nucleotide sequence of the entire human genome without any intervention by "ethical experts" or those trusted to represent the concerns and preferences of interested parties. But there is no such contentment. Authority to speak on what is true is disengaged from authority to speak on what is good. As a lay member of late-twentieth-century American society, I recognize that sentiment and have found myself endorsing it frequently enough. I have not routinely imputed special virtue to scientists and physicians, just as I am sure that few modern scientists regard themselves, or wish to be regarded, as moral paragons, with all the attendant responsibility. I have no very clever ideas about how the relationship between morality and expertise ought to be managed, and, while in general I like the idea of opening up decision-making processes to a range of interested parties, I am not comfortable with the notion of ethical expertise. For all that, I do not expect that my personal views on such matters ought to be of the slightest interest to anyone. It is, rather, as an historian of early modern science and as a sociologist of scientific knowledge that I feel I might have something to contribute to contemporary d...

### Research Analysis (Cycle 6)

This cycle’s results have firmly established a focus on the practical constraints and biases introduced by tools and frameworks used in scientific reasoning, shifting from a purely philosophical understanding of 'why?' to a more critical investigation of *how* science is conducted and validated. The new search results on formal logic and software limitations highlight the influence of technical and institutional structures on the scientific process. The findings underscore that the limitations of earlier tools and practices influenced both the types of questions asked and the ways in which theories were presented and accepted. While falsifiability and logical rigor remain important, the emphasis is now on understanding the broader context within which scientific knowledge is produced, emphasizing the need to assess the impact of formalization and software on the research process.

*Search query: early science abduction hypothesis formation explanatory power*

Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy Abduction First published Wed Mar 9, 2011; substantive revision Tue May 18, 2021 In the philosophical literature, the term “abduction” is
used in two related but different senses. In both senses, the term
refers to some form of explanatory reasoning. However, in the
historically first sense, it refers to the place of explanatory
reasoning in generating hypotheses, while in the sense in
which it is used most frequently in the modern literature it refers to
the place of explanatory reasoning in justifying hypotheses.
In the latter sense, abduction is also often called “Inference
to the Best Explanation.” This entry is exclusively concerned with abduction in the modern
sense, although there is a supplement on abduction in the historical
sense, which had its origin in the work of Charles Sanders
Peirce—see the Supplement: Peirce on Abduction . See also the entry on scientific discovery ,
in particular the section on discovery as abduction. Most philosophers agree that abduction (in the sense of Inference to
the Best Explanation) is a type of inference that is frequently
employed, in some form or other, both in everyday and in scientific
reasoning. However, the exact form as well as the normative status of
abduction are still matters of controversy. This entry contrasts
abduction with other types of inference; points at prominent uses of
it, both in and outside philosophy; considers various more or less
precise statements of it; discusses its normative status; and
highlights possible connections between abduction and Bayesian
confirmation theory. 1. Abduction: The General Idea You happen to know that Tim and Harry have recently had a terrible row
that ended their friendship. Now someone tells you that she just saw
Tim and Harry jogging together. The best explanation for this that you
can think of is that they made up. You conclude that they are friends
again. One morning you enter the kitchen to find a plate and cup on the
table, with breadcrumbs and a pat of butter on it, and surrounded by a
jar of jam, a pack of sugar, and an empty carton of milk. You conclude
that one of your house-mates got up at night to make him- or herself a
midnight snack and was too tired to clear the table. This, you think,
best explains the scene you are facing. To be sure, it might be that
someone burgled the house and took the time to have a bite while on
the job, or a house-mate might have arranged the things on the table
without having a midnight snack but just to make you believe that
someone had a midnight snack. But these hypotheses strike you as
providing much more contrived explanations of the data than the one
you infer to. Walking along the beach, you see what looks like a picture of Winston
Churchill in the sand. It could be that, as in the opening pages of
Hilary Putnam’s book Reason, Truth, and History ,
(1981), what you see is actually the trace of an ant crawling on the
beach. The much simpler, and therefore (you think) much better,
explanation is that someone intentionally drew a picture of Churchill
in the sand. That, in any case, is what you come away believing. In these examples, the conclusions do not follow logically from the
premises. For instance, it does not follow logically that Tim and
Harry are friends again from the premises that they had a terrible row
which ended their friendship and that they have just been seen jogging
together; it does not even follow, we may suppose, from all the
information you have about Tim and Harry. Nor do you have any useful
statistical data about friendships, terrible rows, and joggers that
might warrant an inference from the information that you have about
Tim and Harry to the conclusion that they are friends again, or even
to the conclusion that, probably (or with a certain probability), they
are friends again. What leads you to the conclusion, and what
according to a considerable number of philosophers may...

Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy Archive Summer 2024 Edition Process Philosophy First published Mon Oct 15, 2012; substantive revision Thu May 26, 2022 Process philosophy is based on the premise that being is dynamic and
that the dynamic nature of being should be the primary focus of any
comprehensive philosophical account of reality and our place within
it. Even though we experience our world and ourselves as continuously
changing, Western metaphysics has long been obsessed with describing
reality as an assembly of static individuals whose dynamic features
are either taken to be mere appearances or ontologically secondary and
derivative. For process philosophers the adventure of philosophy
begins with a set of problems that traditional metaphysics
marginalizes or even sidesteps altogether: what is dynamicity or becoming —if it is the way we experience reality, how
should we interpret this metaphysically? Are there several varieties
of becoming—for instance, the uniform going on of activities
versus the coming about of developments? Do all developments have the
same way of occurring quite independently of what is
coming about? How can we best classify into different kinds of occurrences? How can we understand the emergence of apparently
novel conditions? Can we conceive of becoming or dynamic being
independently of space and time? While process philosophers insist that all within and about reality is
continuously going on and coming about, they do not deny that there
are temporally stable and reliably recurrent aspects of reality. But
they take such aspects of persistence to be the regular behavior of
dynamic organizations that arise due to the continuously ongoing
interaction of processes. In order to articulate a process view of
reality, special theoretical efforts are required, however, since the
standard theoretical tools of Western metaphysics are geared to the
static view of reality. Especially the standard interpretation of
predicate logic in terms of static individuals with properties that
are exemplified timelessly or at a temporal instant consolidates what
is from the process-philosophical perspective an unhelpful theoretical
bias. This has forced upon process philosophy a double role as. a metaphysical and metaphilosophical enterprise—pushing
for a paradigm change, process philosophy has the double task of
developing new explanatory concepts and providing arguments
for why these concepts better serve the aims of philosophy. Process philosophy centers on ontology and metaphysics, but it has
full systematic scope: its concern is with the dynamic sense of being
as becoming or occurrence, the conditions of spatio-temporal
existence, the kinds of dynamic entities, including mental occurrences
and actions, the relationship between mind and world, and the
realization of values in action. Some approaches to process philosophy
are conceived on the grand scale and offer a full-scope metaphysics in
the form of a systematic theory or comprehensive philosophical view.
Other approaches, especially more recent ones, take a more modest
approach. They pursue the specific problems that the various
philosophical disciplines are engaged in while focusing on the dynamic
aspects of each sub-domain. Such process ontologies, process ethics,
process epistemologies, process theories of mind etc. are
contributions to ‘process philosophy’ more broadly
conceived as a research paradigm of philosophical inquiry. They share
the guiding idea that natural existence consists in modes of becoming
and types of occurrences. ‘Processists’ agree that the
world is an assembly of physical, organic, social, and cognitive
processes that interact at and across levels of dynamic organization.
However, within that broad framework, process philosophers debate
about how such a world of processes is to be construed, how it relates
to the human mind (which is another process) and how the dynamic. nature of reali...

Skip to content Submitted by Professor Ibrahim B. Syed Summary Ibn Al-Haytham (known in the west as Alhazen) which is considered to be the greatest Muslim doctor and one of the greatest researches of optics for all times. Al Haytham is born in city Basra and immigrated to Egypt during reign of Caliph Al Hakim. He is quoted as excellent astronomer, mathematician and doctor as well as one of the best commentators of the Galen and Aristotle’s work. He is the first medical scholar who teaches that light “does not originates from the eye but on opposite enters the eye”, and in that manner corrects the wrong opinion of the Greeks about the nature of vision. According to this scholar retina is the center of vision and the impressions that it receives are transferred to the brain by the optical nerve, in order that brain afterwards create visual image in the symmetrical relationship for both retinas. Al-Haytham was the most important researcher of optics. He was convinced that the adequate theory of vision must combine Euclid and Ptolemy “mathematical” approach and “physical doctrine of the naturalists. The result of his reflections in the paper “Optics”, supported by the experimental approach, is the new theory of vision, much richer and perfected than any before. He thought that light and color, two physical features that exist independently from the observed subject, in strait lines originates from each point of visible object. Al Haytham concludes that what we perceive is actually the object which is on a certain distance from the eye and which have certain shape and size, and vision itself is the result of intervention by the visual material received by the brain and stored information’s from previous experiences. Reception hypothesis (intromission) Al-Haytham exposed to mathematical testing, and then incorporated into already developed perception theory, which is still not completely explored by historians. In his experiments he used “dark chambers”, trying to confirm the features of light, such as expansion in straight lines, reflexion and refraction of the light beams. Basic stand point which he supported was that the vision is the result of impression which light leaves on the sight sense, he supported it based on the experience that the eye “retains an image” or has pain when looking into bright light. Theory of vision by Haytham Optics, written in Egypt during the first half of XI century, overmatches Galen, Euclid and Ptolemy ones. [1] Hasan Ibn al-Haytham (Alhazen) was Born in 965 CE in Basra, Iraq and Died in 1040 CE in Cairo, Egypt. He resided in Basra and Cairo. He is also called “Basri” after his native place. He held a position with the title vizier in his native Basra, and made a name for himself for his knowledge of applied mathematics. He is Known for Book of Optics, Doubts Concerning Ptolemy, Alhazen’s problem, Analysis, Catoptrics, Horopter, Moon illusion, experimental science, scientific methodology, visual perception, empirical theory of perception, Animal psychology. Scientific career He is known in the fields of Optics, Astronomy, and Mathematics who made significant contributions to the principles of optics and the use of scientific experiments. He was Influenced by Aristotle, Euclid, Ptolemy, Galen, Banu Mūsā, Thābit ibn Qurra, Al-Kindi, Ibn Sahl, Abū Sahl al-Qūhī. Hasan Ibn al-Haytham (Alhazen) Influenced Omar Khayyam, Taqi ad-Din Muhammad ibn Ma’ruf, Kamāl al-Dīn al-Fārisī, Averroes, Al-Khazini, John Peckham, Witelo, Roger Bacon, Kepler. Hasan Ibn al-Haytham (Latinized Alhazen ) has a full name Abū ʿAlī al-Ḥasan ibn al-Ḥasan ibn al-Haytham ( 965 CE – 1040 CE) was an Arab mathematician, astronomer, and physicist of the Islamic Golden Age. Sometimes called “the father of modern optics”, he made significant contributions to the principles of optics and visual perception in particular, his most influential work being his Kitāb al-Manāẓir (“Book of Optics”), written during 1011–1021, which survived in the Lat...

*Search query: Popper falsification utility coherence scientific justification*

Logic Falsification: Popper’s Method for Scientific Progress October 15, 2023 Falsification is one of the most crucial concepts in the philosophy of science. It is often associated with the Austrian-British philosopher Karl Popper , who introduced it as a method for distinguishing between scientific and non-scientific theories. Popper’s theory of falsification is not just a philosophical idea but a practical tool that scientists use to ensure that their theories remain testable and adaptable. In this post, we’ll delve into how falsification works, its role in scientific progress, and its application in hypothesis testing, while also considering its limitations and critiques. Table of Contents What is falsification? The role of falsification in demarcating science from non-science How falsification works in hypothesis testing Falsification and scientific progress The process of falsification in scientific inquiry Critiques and limitations of falsification Conclusion What is falsification? 🔗 Falsification, in simple terms, is the process of testing a theory or hypothesis to see if it can be proven false. According to Popper, for a theory to be scientific, it must be possible to imagine an observation or experiment that could show it to be wrong. If a theory is structured in such a way that no evidence could potentially disprove it, then it is not a scientific theory, but rather a belief or a pseudoscience. For instance, the claim “All swans are white” is falsifiable because observing a black swan would directly contradict the theory. However, a statement like “The universe is as it is” cannot be falsified, as there is no conceivable way to test it with evidence. The role of falsification in demarcating science from non-science 🔗 One of the most famous applications of falsification is Popper’s attempt to distinguish between science and pseudoscience. Before Popper, philosophers like the logical positivists believed that science could be demarcated from non-science through verification: if a statement could be verified by experience or observation, then it was scientific. However, Popper argued that this approach was flawed because it would allow unfalsifiable theories to be considered scientific, even if they lacked any empirical evidence. Instead, Popper proposed that scientific theories should always be open to the possibility of being proven false. This principle became known as the demarcation criterion. For Popper, scientific theories such as Einstein’s theory of relativity or Darwin’s theory of evolution are valuable precisely because they are falsifiable. Theories that cannot be tested or disproven—like astrology or Freudian psychoanalysis —fail to meet the falsification criterion, which is why Popper classified them as pseudosciences. This criterion provides a clear method for distinguishing between fields of knowledge that adhere to empirical testing and those that do not. How falsification works in hypothesis testing 🔗 Falsification is a method applied during the process of hypothesis testing. In this process, scientists begin with a hypothesis—a proposed explanation for a phenomenon—and test it against observable data. The goal is to identify whether the hypothesis can be refuted by the data. If the hypothesis is falsified, it must either be abandoned or revised. On the other hand, if the hypothesis withstands scrutiny, it becomes more reliable, though still subject to future testing and refinement. Let’s illustrate this with a simple example: Suppose a scientist hypothesizes that “Water boils at 100°C under standard atmospheric pressure.” This hypothesis can be tested by boiling water at standard pressure. If the water boils at 100°C, the hypothesis is not falsified. However, if the water boils at 99°C or 101°C, the hypothesis is falsified, and the scientist must rethink the theory or revise the hypothesis. This process of testing and refining theories through falsification is what drives scientific progress. Falsific...

### Research Analysis (Cycle 7)

This cycle has significantly refined our understanding of the interplay between theoretical frameworks, practical tools, and societal influences shaping scientific inquiry. The search results regarding software limitations and institutional structures highlight that early scientific reasoning was not solely driven by abstract principles but was also constrained and directed by the available technologies and the broader social and political context. The findings from the latest cycle reinforce the need to critically examine the assumptions and biases embedded in formalization processes, extending beyond Popper’s falsifiability to consider the broader impact of tool design and institutional pressures on the direction of scientific inquiry.  We now need to focus on specifically understanding the development of and rationale behind formalization of theories, to truly understand how they impact the overall process of scientific justification.

Please help improve it to make it understandable to non-experts , without removing the technical details. ( January 2015 ) ( Learn how and when to remove this message ) ( Learn how and when to remove this message ) The Institutional Analysis and Development framework ( IAD ) is a theoretical framework for investigating how people ("actors") interact with common-pool resources (CPRs). CPRs are economic goods which are rivalrous (i.e. one person's use reduces the ability of others to use) and non-excludable (i.e. it's impractical to prevent people accessing it) - examples include forests as a source of timber, or fields as a source of pasture. It was developed by Elinor Ostrom , an American political scientist and the first woman to receive the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences in 2009. [ 1 ] Ostrom researched which institutional structures supported CPR actors to sustainably use their resources, balancing individuals' use with the interest of a wider public. Under rational choice assumptions, the IAD was devised in an attempt to explain and predict outcomes by formally exploring and documenting governance structures, actors' positions, and informal and formal rules. Thus, the IAD is a systematic method to document policy analysis functions similar to analytic technique commonly used in physical and social sciences to understand how institutions operate and change over a period of time. [ 2 ] [ 3 ] Components of the framework edit IAD framework diagram Ostrom thought of the IAD as a "multi-level conceptual map" with which one could zoom in and out of particular hierarchical parts of the governance structures in a social system. The IAD framework helps to perceive complex collective action problems by dividing them into 'action arenas', that are smaller pieces of practically understandable function. [ 2 ] The analyst assumes that the structure of the action situation is fixed in the short-term. For an action situation to exist, there must be "actors in positions" (the number of possible roles that are available in this recurring interaction situation). [ 4 ] Actors have choices within the existing (rule) structure. In the study of outcomes from collective choice situations, actors are influenced by the institutional arrangements, the socio-economic conditions, and the physical environment. [ 5 ] The institutional arrangements can be studied by seven rule types (as per below).

[ A ] Falsifiability (or refutability ) is a deductive standard of evaluation of scientific theories and hypotheses, introduced by the philosopher of science Karl Popper in his book The Logic of Scientific Discovery (1934). [ B ] A theory or hypothesis is falsifiable if it can be logically contradicted by an empirical test . Popper emphasized the asymmetry created by the relation of a universal law with basic observation statements [ C ] and contrasted falsifiability to the intuitively similar concept of verifiability that was then current in logical positivism . He argued that the only way to verify a claim such as "All swans are white" would be if one could theoretically observe all swans, [ D ] which is not possible. On the other hand, the falsifiability requirement for an anomalous instance, such as the observation of a single black swan, is theoretically reasonable and sufficient to logically falsify the claim. Popper proposed falsifiability as the cornerstone solution to both the problem of induction and the problem of demarcation . He insisted that, as a logical criterion, his falsifiability is distinct from the related concept "capacity to be proven wrong" discussed in Lakatos's falsificationism . [ E ] [ F ] [ G ] Even being a logical criterion, its purpose is to make the theory predictive and testable , and thus useful in practice. By contrast, the Duhem–Quine thesis says that definitive experimental falsifications are impossible [ 1 ] and that no scientific hypothesis is by itself capable of making predictions, because an empirical test of the hypothesis requires one or more background assumptions. [ 2 ] Popper's response is that falsifiability does not have the Duhem problem [ H ] because it is a logical criterion. Experimental research has the Duhem problem and other problems, such as the problem of induction, [ I ] but, according to Popper, statistical tests, which are only possible when a theory is falsifiable, can still be useful within a critical discussion . As a key notion in the separation of science from non-science and pseudoscience , falsifiability has featured prominently in many scientific controversies and applications, even being used as legal precedent. However, falsifiability is not a sufficient condition for demarcating science as theories have to actually be tested in order to eliminate theories that are wrong. In scientific practice, this can cause theories to change from being falsified back to unfalsified, such as when the once-falsified geocentric world view was restored as a viable reference frame within special relativity . There is ambiguity surrounding the status of theories that cannot currently be tested.

### Research Analysis (Cycle 8)

This cycle's search results have strongly emphasized the impact of practical tools and institutional structures on scientific reasoning, building directly on the work done in cycles 4-6. The recurring themes of software limitations, formalization processes, and the influence of institutional agendas necessitate a more critical assessment of *how* science is conducted rather than just the theoretical frameworks underlying it.  The identification of 'hypothesis formalization' as a new topic highlights the critical need to understand the translation process between conceptual thought and testable models. We’re moving beyond analyzing philosophies of justification and now need to examine the mechanics of scientific practice. The recurring feedback loop between theoretical understanding, technological advancement, and institutional pressures is crucial for a complete understanding of the 'why?' of scientific inquiry, specifically now considering the influence of formal models, design implications, and software functionality.

The underuse, superficial use, and misuse of theories pose a substantial scientific challenge for implementation science and may relate to challenges in selecting from the many theories in the field. Implementation scientists may benefit from guidance for selecting a theory for a specific study or project. Understanding how implementation scientists select theories will help inform efforts to develop such guidance. Our objective was to identify which theories implementation scientists use, how they use theories, and the criteria used to select theories. Methods We identified initial lists of uses and criteria for selecting implementation theories based on seminal articles and an iterative consensus process. We incorporated these lists into a self-administered survey for completion by self-identified implementation scientists. We recruited potential respondents at the 8th Annual Conference on the Science of Dissemination and Implementation in Health and via several international email lists. We used frequencies and percentages to report results. Results Two hundred twenty-three implementation scientists from 12 countries responded to the survey. They reported using more than 100 different theories spanning several disciplines. Respondents reported using theories primarily to identify implementation determinants, inform data collection, enhance conceptual clarity, and guide implementation planning. Of the 19 criteria presented in the survey, the criteria used by the most respondents to select theory included analytic level (58%), logical consistency/plausibility (56%), empirical support (53%), and description of a change process (54%). The criteria used by the fewest respondents included fecundity (10%), uniqueness (12%), and falsifiability (15%). Conclusions Implementation scientists use a large number of criteria to select theories, but there is little consensus on which are most important. Our results suggest that the selection of implementation theories is often haphazard or driven by convenience or prior exposure. Variation in approaches to selecting theory warn against prescriptive guidance for theory selection. Instead, implementation scientists may benefit from considering the criteria that we propose in this paper and using them to justify their theory selection. Future research should seek to refine the criteria for theory selection to promote more consistent and appropriate use of theory in implementation science. Peer Review reports Background Theories and frameworks offer an efficient way of generalizing findings across diverse settings within implementation science [ 1 ]. Theories and frameworks (see Department of Veterans Health Administration’s Quality Enhancement Research Initiative [2013] for a taxonomy of theories, frameworks, and models, hereafter “theories”) generalize findings by providing a synthesizing architecture—that is, an explicit summary of explanations of implementation-related phenomena to promote progress and facilitate shared understanding [ 2 ]. Furthermore, theories guide implementation, facilitate the identification of determinants of implementation, guide the selection o...

Using statistics to answer real-world questions requires four steps: (i) translating high-level, domain-
specific questions and hypotheses into specific statistical questions [ 16]; (ii) identifying statistical
models to answer the statistical questions; (iii) implementing and executing these statistical models,
typically with the help of software tools; and (iv) interpreting the results, considering the domain-
specific questions and applying analytical reasoning.
For example, suppose a census researcher asked, “In the United States (U.S.), how does an
individual’s sex relate to their annual income?” Drawing upon their prior experiences and exploratory
data visualizations, the researcher knows that income in the U.S. is skewed, and they want to
know how the distributions of income among males and females differ (step i). However, before
implementing, they (implicitly) define their causal model: The researcher knows that other factors,
such as education and race, may be associated with employment opportunities, which may then
influence income. As such, they refine their conceptual hypothesis to consider the possible effects of

Universe Expansion, Big Bang, Dark Matter, and Dark Energy Rugge ro Maria Santilli* Institute for Basic Research, P. O. Box 1577, Palm Harbor, FL 34682, USA Abstract: In this paper, we present systematic studies on the insufficiencies of special relativity within physical media, such as water, atmospheres and the interior of astrophysical bodies. We outline the rather large body of research on the deformations of special relativity applicable within physical media, known under the name of isotopies. We then present, apparently for the first time, experimental verifications of the hypothesis formulated by the author in 1991, and today known as isoredshift, according to which light propagating within a physical medium experiences a shift of its frequency toward the red without any relative motion between the source, the medium and the observer, the shift originating from expected loss of energy to the medium due to interactions. We then confirm the isoredshift in the colors of our atmosphere as well as in the large difference in cosmological redshift between certain quasars and their associated galaxies; we indi-cate the consequential conceivable absence of universe expansion, big bang, dark matter, and dark energy; and propose systematic tests for the resolution of cosmological models via experiments on Earth along the teaching of Galileo Galilei. Keywords: Isoredshift, dark energy, dark matter, big bang. 1. THE INTRIGUING HISTORY OF LIGHT As it is well known (see, e.g., Ref. [1]), Alhazen initiated in 1021 the conception of light as made up of particles, a conception that was subsequently supported by numerous scientists, most notably by Newton. The advent in 1873 of Maxwell's equations supported the alternative interpretation of light as being made up of (transversal) electromagnetic waves propagated by a universal substratum (ether), thus resolving in this way known insufficiencies of the conception of light as being made up of particles. Nevertheless, with the discovery of the black body radiation, the wave interpretation of light resulted in being insufficient to represent all data, most notably, the discrete character of the absorption and emission of light by atoms. The latter impasse was resolved by Einstein in 1905 with his conception of light as being made up of basic quantum particles called  photons with energy
E=h!. In view of the vast experimental evidence in atomic spectroscopy confirming the existence of photons, as well as the historical difficulties posed by the ether for special relativity, during the past century all possible manifestations of light have been reduced to photons propagating in vacuum so as to achieve compatibility with special relativity. Recall that the validity and experimental verifications of special relativity are beyond doubt for the conditions clearly stated by Einstein, i.e., for point-like particles and electromagnetic waves  propagating  in  empty  space, condi-   *Address correspondence to this author at the Institute for Basic Research, P.

The open issue underlying this paper is whether special relativity is still exact or only approximately valid for physical conditions significantly beyond those of its original conception, generally those of extended particles and electromagnetic waves propagating within physical media, historically referred to as  interior dynamical problems, for which no  direct experimental verifications comparable to those in vacuum exist at this writing.

*Search query: Popper falsifiability explanatory power coherence software design limitations*

Skip to content UPDATE: In a comment below this post , reader Peter Beattie calls attention to a short summary of Popper’s falsifiability criterion that he thinks will be helpful to readers who want the nuances of Popper’s views. __(...)__ This will be short. As many of us know, Karl Popper demarcated a scientific theory from a nonscientific one because the former is falsifiable —there are experiments or observations that can be done to disprove it. The “theory” of evolution, for example, could be disproven if we regularly found well-dated fossils out of the proper order (like mammals in the Devonian, for instance), if species didn’t have genetic variation to respond to selection, or if we often found “adaptations” in member of one species that were useful only for another species (e.g., a special nipple on a female mole that was only used for suckling mice). I’m told that falsification is naive as a criterion for good science, and that scientists no longer accept or use that as a criterion. Some assert that, in contrast, a good scientific theory is one that best explains the data we have. But it seems to me that this is equivalent to falsifiability, for a theory that best explains the data we have could be shown not to explain the data we have. At any rate, putting this musing aside, my question is this: is there any scientific fact or theory that is widely accepted despite the fact that it is not in principle capable of being falsified? I am referring to real theories here, not possible theories. It is my impression, for instance, that string theory in physics isn’t widely accepted as true simply because we haven’t found a way to test it—to test that its predictions are verified or not. And I often hear—Anthony Grayling and Hitchens both said this, I believe—that a theory that can explain everything explains nothing (i.e., God constructed the process of evolution). In other words, a theory that can’t be shown wrong is useless. The presupposes falsifiability as a criterion for scientific truth. Englighten me here, but note that this discussion deals with the philosophy of science, so if you think that endeavor is useless you shouldn’t be responding! Share this: Tweet Click to email a link to a friend (Opens in new window) Email 231 thoughts on “ Is falsifiability a good criterion for a scientific theory? ” I think falsifiability is an important defining feature of science, but it is not the only one. In other words, the mere fact your idea is falsifiable does not make it scientific. But I to have heard falsifiability is not the be all and end all of science but most of that centres around the fact other criteria should also be involved, not that falsifiability should be dropped. My thoughts above reconcile the two views, imo. The most convincing alternative to falsifiability as a measure of science is pragmatism, that ideas be judged on their results. However, I don’t see how that is mutually exclusive with falsifiability. Falsification is more a special case of simplicity… which criterion Popper also noted as in use. He just got the ultimate philosophical justification wrong. If it is describing testability it isn’t simplicity, but whether it works at all. However that may be, I think Benton nailed it. Are ther any scientific claims (outside mathematics) that are not falsifiable but are nonetheless provabale? Proven? True? One thinks of astranomical processes distant in time and space – but doesn’t that just underline the fact that they, like all scientific claims are provisional, and while falsifiablity may not be possible or practicable, it remains the gold standard to which all claims aspire? Arguably the most general of hypotheses (see my earlier posts on metaphysics and science) cannot be directly refuted; only refuted by having unfruitful consequences. This is why I would say things like automata theory count as metaphysics (what could refute *that*) and yet automata theory is clearly a factual field (and, as it ha...

### Research Analysis (Cycle 9)

This cycle has significantly reinforced the importance of practical constraints and institutional influences on scientific reasoning. The recurring themes of software limitations and formalization processes necessitate a critical assessment of *how* science is conducted, moving beyond purely philosophical justifications. Hypothesis formalization has emerged as a core topic, reflecting the critical need to understand the translation process between conceptual thought and testable models, specifically how software tools are involved.  This cycle's focus on software and formalization requires re-evaluating previously 'partial' topics to consider how tools and institutional structures shaped those understandings. Further investigation into how logic systems evolved and impacted scientific reasoning is warranted, alongside a deeper dive into how institutions guided research agendas, shaping the overall trajectory of early scientific inquiry.

Skip to content Ibn al-Haytham (Alhazen) – Father of Optics Submitted by Professor Ibrahim B. Syed Summary Ibn Al-Haytham (known in the west as Alhazen) which is considered to be the greatest Muslim doctor and one of the greatest researches of optics for all times. Al Haytham is born in city Basra and immigrated to Egypt during reign of Caliph Al Hakim. He is quoted as excellent astronomer, mathematician and doctor as well as one of the best commentators of the Galen and Aristotle’s work. He is the first medical scholar who teaches that light “does not originates from the eye but on opposite enters the eye”, and in that manner corrects the wrong opinion of the Greeks about the nature of vision. According to this scholar retina is the center of vision and the impressions that it receives are transferred to the brain by the optical nerve, in order that brain afterwards create visual image in the symmetrical relationship for both retinas. Al-Haytham was the most important researcher of optics. He was convinced that the adequate theory of vision must combine Euclid and Ptolemy “mathematical” approach and “physical doctrine of the naturalists. The result of his reflections in the paper “Optics”, supported by the experimental approach, is the new theory of vision, much richer and perfected than any before. He thought that light and color, two physical features that exist independently from the observed subject, in strait lines originates from each point of visible object. Al Haytham concludes that what we perceive is actually the object which is on a certain distance from the eye and which have certain shape and size, and vision itself is the result of intervention by the visual material received by the brain and stored information’s from previous experiences. Reception hypothesis (intromission) Al-Haytham exposed to mathematical testing, and then incorporated into already developed perception theory, which is still not completely explored by historians. In his experiments he used “dark chambers”, trying to confirm the features of light, such as expansion in straight lines, reflexion and refraction of the light beams. Basic stand point which he supported was that the vision is the result of impression which light leaves on the sight sense, he supported it based on the experience that the eye “retains an image” or has pain when looking into bright light. Theory of vision by Haytham Optics, written in Egypt during the first half of XI century, overmatches Galen, Euclid and Ptolemy ones. [1] Hasan Ibn al-Haytham (Alhazen) was Born in 965 CE in Basra, Iraq and Died in 1040 CE in Cairo, Egypt. He resided in Basra and Cairo. He is also called “Basri” after his native place. He held a position with the title vizier in his native Basra, and made a name for himself for his knowledge of applied mathematics. He is Known for Book of Optics, Doubts Concerning Ptolemy, Alhazen’s problem, Analysis, Catoptrics, Horopter, Moon illusion, experimental science, scientific methodology, visual perception, empirical theory of perception, Animal psychology. Scientific career He is known in the fields of Optics, Astronomy, and Mathematics who made significant contributions to the principles of optics and the use of scientific experiments. He was Influenced by Aristotle, Euclid, Ptolemy, Galen, Banu Mūsā, Thābit ibn Qurra, Al-Kindi, Ibn Sahl, Abū Sahl al-Qūhī. Hasan Ibn al-Haytham (Alhazen) Influenced Omar Khayyam, Taqi ad-Din Muhammad ibn Ma’ruf, Kamāl al-Dīn al-Fārisī, Averroes, Al-Khazini, John Peckham, Witelo, Roger Bacon, Kepler. Hasan Ibn al-Haytham (Latinized Alhazen) has a full name Abū ʿAlī al-Ḥasan ibn al-Ḥasan ibn al-Haytham ( 965 CE – 1040 CE) was an Arab mathematician, astronomer, and physicist of the Islamic Golden Age. Sometimes called “the father of modern optics”, he made significant contributions to the principles of optics and visual perception in particular, his most influential work being his Kitāb al-Manāẓir (“Book of Optics”), written...

In a lab study, we find that analysts fixated on implementation and shaped their analysis to fit familiar approaches, even if sub-optimal. In an analysis of software tools, we find that tools provide inconsistent, low-level abstractions that may limit the statistical models analysts use to formalize hypotheses. Based on these observations, we characterize hypothesis formalization as a dual-search process balancing conceptual and statistical considerations constrained by data and computation, and discuss implications for future tools.

*Search query: teleology justifications rational principles early scientific inquiry*

Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy Teleological Arguments for God’s Existence First published Fri Jun 10, 2005; substantive revision Wed Apr 5, 2023 Some phenomena within nature exhibit such exquisiteness of structure,
function or interconnectedness that many people have found it natural
to see a deliberative and directive mind behind those phenomena. The
mind in question is typically taken to be supernatural.
Philosophically inclined thinkers have both historically and at
present labored to shape the relevant intuition into a more formal,
logically rigorous inference. The resultant theistic arguments, in
their various logical forms, share a focus on plan, purpose,
intention, and design, and are thus classified as teleological
arguments (or, frequently, as arguments from or to design). Although enjoying some prominent defenders over the centuries, such
arguments have also attracted serious criticisms from major historical
and contemporary thinkers. Critics and advocates include not only
philosophers but also scientists and thinkers from other disciplines
as well. In the following discussion, major variant forms of
teleological arguments will be distinguished and explored, traditional
philosophical and other criticisms will be discussed, and the most
prominent contemporary turns (cosmic fine tuning arguments,
many-worlds theories, and the Intelligent Design debate) will be
tracked. Discussion will conclude with a brief look at one
historically important non-inferential approach to the issue. 1. Introduction It is not uncommon for humans to find themselves with the intuition
that random, unplanned, unexplained accident just couldn’t produce the order, beauty, elegance, and
seeming purpose that we experience in the natural world around us. As
Hume’s interlocutor Cleanthes put it, we seem to see “the
image of mind reflected on us from innumerable objects” in
nature (Hume 1779 [1998], 35). And many people find themselves
convinced that no explanation for that mind-resonance which
fails to acknowledge a causal role for intelligence, intent and
purpose in nature can be seriously plausible. Cosmological arguments often begin with the bare fact that there are
contingently existing things and end with conclusions concerning the
existence of a cause with the power to account for the existence of those contingent things. Others reason from the
premise that the universe has not always existed to a cause that
brought it into being. Teleological arguments (or arguments from
design ) by contrast begin with a much more specialized catalogue
of properties and end with a conclusion concerning the existence of a
designer with the intellectual properties (knowledge,
purpose, understanding, foresight, wisdom, intention) necessary to design the things exhibiting the special properties in
question. In broad outline, then, teleological arguments focus upon
finding and identifying various traces of the operation of a mind in
nature’s temporal and physical structures, behaviors and paths. Order of some significant type is usually the starting point
of design arguments. Design-type arguments are largely unproblematic when based upon things
nature clearly could not or would not produce (e.g.,
most human artifacts), or when the intelligent agency is itself
‘natural’ (human, alien, etc.). Identifying designed
traces of ‘lost’ human civilizations or even non-human
civilizations (via SETI) could in principle be uncontroversial.
Objections to design inferences typically arise only when the posited
designer is something more exotic or perhaps supernatural. But despite the variety of spirited critical attacks they have
elicited, design arguments have historically had and continue to have
widespread intuitive appeal—indeed, it is sometimes claimed that
design arguments are the most persuasive of all purely philosophical
theistic arguments. Note that while design arguments have. traditionally been employed to supp...

### Research Analysis (Cycle 10)

Cycle 10 results have definitively underscored the crucial and pervasive influence of tools and institutional structures on scientific reasoning.  The focus has shifted from purely philosophical and methodological inquiries to a detailed examination of *how* science is done—the software, the instruments, the funding mechanisms, and the organizational biases.  The recognition that 'hypothesis formalization' is an ongoing and shape-shifting process necessitates that we re-evaluate the partially addressed topics with this new lens. We are now moving beyond a simple timeline of ideas and methodologies to critically examine how these are mediated by technology and power.

# From Myth to Mechanism: A Historical Analysis of Early Explanatory Frameworks

## Tracing the Evolution of Causation, Observation, and the Foundations of Scientific Reasoning

## Abstract

This research examines the historical evolution of explanatory frameworks, tracing the shift from mythological and teleological understandings of causation to modern mechanistic and iterative scientific methodologies. Early explanations relied heavily on attributing agency and purpose to supernatural forces, gradually transitioning towards identifying impersonal principles and empirical observation with figures like Alhazen and Avicenna. The study highlights the critical interplay between deductive, inductive, and abductive reasoning in hypothesis formation, emphasizing that scientific progress isn’t a linear accumulation of facts but a cyclical process of observation, experimentation, and refinement driven by the confrontation of anomalies. A significant focus is placed on the epistemological challenges inherent in justifying beliefs, specifically regarding testimonial knowledge and the avoidance of infinite regress, drawing on the medieval philosophical insights of John Duns Scotus who posited that justification doesn't necessarily require an infinite chain of reasoning. The research demonstrates that robust scientific knowledge relies on the combined principles of testability, falsifiability, reproducibility, and a willingness to revise established frameworks in light of new evidence, underscoring the enduring human tendency to seek meaningful explanations even within a universe increasingly understood through mechanistic principles.

## Introduction

Research Query: Why? - The Historical Roots of Explanation. - Formulating Explanatory Hypotheses. - Evaluating Explanations: Testability & Falsifiability. - Refining Explanations: Iteration & Philosophical Foundations.

This report examines the historical development of explanatory frameworks, beginning with early mythological and philosophical approaches to understanding natural phenomena. It traces the evolution from attributing causation to supernatural forces toward rational principles and, ultimately, the emphasis on empirical observation and testability characteristic of modern science. 

The central focus is on the process of formulating and evaluating explanations, investigating reasoning methods such as deduction, induction, and abduction. The report details how hypotheses are generated, the role of anomalies in theory revision, and the criteria for evaluating explanatory power – particularly the principle of falsifiability.

Finally, the report considers the iterative nature of scientific understanding and explores the underlying philosophical foundations that inform the pursuit of justified belief, culminating in an examination of the challenges associated with knowledge acquisition and the role of intuition in grounding explanations. This investigation provides a nuanced understanding of not only *how* explanations are constructed, but also *why* and *to what end*.

## The Historical Roots of Explanation

## Early Understandings of Explanation

Early understandings of causation were deeply interwoven with mythological and pre-scientific worldviews. Before the development of systematic philosophical inquiry, explanations for natural phenomena often resided in narratives attributing agency and intention to supernatural entities [1, 2]. These mythological accounts didn't necessarily posit a *mechanism* of causation in the modern sense, but rather established relationships between events through stories of gods, spirits, and ancestral beings actively intervening in the world [2]. For example, ancient Mesopotamian and Egyptian cosmologies explained natural occurrences—like the flooding of rivers or the changing of seasons—as the result of divine actions and conflicts, establishing a causal link through narrative authority rather than empirical observation [1]. 

The transition towards philosophical inquiry involved a shift, albeit gradual, from purely mythological explanations to attempts at identifying underlying principles governing natural change. Early Greek philosophers, while still acknowledging the influence of divine forces, began to seek rational explanations for phenomena [1]. This involved moving away from *personal* causation – attributing events to the whims of gods – towards identifying impersonal forces or principles inherent in nature [2]. For instance, Anaximander’s concept of the *apeiron* – an indefinite, boundless substance – represented an attempt to identify a fundamental causal principle underlying all existence, suggesting a non-intentional, material basis for change rather than solely relying on divine agency.

This early philosophical development saw contrasting approaches to causality emerge. Aristotle’s system, fundamentally teleological, posited that understanding any natural phenomenon required grasping its *telos* – its purpose or end [1, 2]. This isn’t merely about final causes as *explanations* but as inherent drivers of natural processes; nature ‘does nothing in vain,’ suggesting an internal rationality guiding development and change [2]. He distinguished between material, formal, efficient, and final causes, believing a complete understanding necessitated acknowledging all four, emphasizing that observing form and purpose was essential for truly knowing a thing’s nature [1]. Epicurus, though also concerned with understanding natural phenomena, departed from Aristotle’s robust teleology [2]. While not rejecting purpose entirely, Epicurus grounded his rational principles in atomism and mechanistic explanations [2]. He believed that all phenomena, including seemingly purposeful biological processes, arose from the interactions of atoms and void, and that any appearance of design was a result of natural selection and chance rather than inherent intention [2]. This emphasis on material causes and the rejection of a divinely-ordained purpose marked a significant shift toward a more mechanistic and empirically-focused rationalism. Despite these differences, both philosophers contributed to the development of rational principles by rejecting purely mythical or supernatural explanations and instead seeking internally consistent, observable principles to explain the natural world [1, 2].

This growing emphasis on rational inquiry was coupled with an increasing role for empirical observation. Both Alhazen (Ibn al-Haytham) and Avicenna (Ibn Sina) represent a significant shift toward empirical observation and experimentation in the pursuit of knowledge, moving beyond purely theoretical or received wisdom [9, 11, 2]. Alhazen, particularly through his *Book of Optics*, emphasized the importance of directly testing hypotheses through controlled experiments, rejecting reliance on accepting established authorities without verification [11]. His work meticulously detailed experiments on light, vision, and optics, demonstrating a systematic approach to observation and analysis—a methodology considered foundational to the scientific method [11, 2]. This included a focus on quantifiable data and the careful documentation of experimental procedures, a departure from earlier reliance on philosophical reasoning alone [2]. Avicenna, while also drawing on Aristotelian and Galenic traditions, integrated empirical observation into his medical practice and philosophical investigations [9]. His *Canon of Medicine* is not merely a compilation of existing knowledge but reflects clinical observation and systematic categorization of diseases and treatments [9]. Though heavily influenced by humoral theory, Avicenna stressed the need for careful observation of symptoms and patient responses to assess the efficacy of treatments [9]. This emphasis on clinical observation and detailed record-keeping laid the groundwork for later advancements in medical diagnosis and treatment, building upon and extending existing practices with empirical data. Both scholars, therefore, exemplify a growing emphasis on *experiential* knowledge—knowledge gained through direct observation and experimentation—as a crucial component of inquiry [2, 9, 11]. 

Ultimately, the historical tension between teleological and mechanistic explanations reflects a broader philosophical debate about the nature of causation and the role of purpose in the universe [1]. While modern science largely favors mechanistic explanations, recognizing the limitations of attributing purpose to natural phenomena, the historical prevalence of teleological thinking underscores the enduring human tendency to seek meaning and intention even in the most seemingly random events [1]. The contrasting approaches highlight the evolution of scientific methodology and the changing conceptions of the relationship between observer, phenomenon, and explanation.

## Formulating Explanatory Hypotheses

Reasoning methods broadly fall into three categories: deduction, induction, and abduction, each differing in how conclusions are reached and the certainty they offer [26]. Deduction starts with general premises to arrive at a logically certain conclusion, guaranteeing the truth of the result *if* the premises are true [32]. Induction, conversely, moves from specific observations to general conclusions, offering a degree of probability but not certainty, as the observed instances may not encompass all possibilities [26]. Unlike deduction and induction, abduction begins with an observation and seeks the *best* explanation for it, forming a hypothesis that, while not necessarily true, provides a plausible account of the phenomenon [28]. Unlike deduction and induction, abduction doesn't guarantee the truth of its conclusion, but it is crucial for generating new ideas and forming hypotheses that can be tested [29].

The distinctions between these methods are not always rigid, and their interplay is central to the process of inquiry [14, 4]. While induction draws generalizations from observed data, abduction proposes potential explanations for surprising or anomalous observations [28]. These proposed explanations can then be rigorously tested through deduction, deriving specific predictions that, if confirmed, lend support to the hypothesis [3, 4]. Peirce emphasized that abduction is not simply ‘guessing’, but a form of inference guided by instinct and experience, aiming for the most economical and plausible explanation [30]. He later refined his views, acknowledging that abduction often precedes induction and deduction as the initial step in generating testable hypotheses [14]. Ultimately, a complete investigation often necessitates the interplay of all three reasoning methods [14, 4]. 

The generation of testable hypotheses is not simply a logical deduction from existing knowledge, but frequently relies on creative leaps and intuitive insights [31]. While established scientific methods emphasize induction and deduction – generalization from observation and logical consequence from premises, respectively – the initial formulation of a hypothesis often stems from abductive reasoning, a process of generating explanatory possibilities from incomplete observations [31]. This “inference to the best explanation” requires identifying relevant patterns and proposing potential mechanisms, a process deeply intertwined with intuition and creative thought [31]. As Peirce described, hypothesis generation involves selecting a plausible explanation from a multitude of possibilities, a task where intuitive “leaps” can connect seemingly disparate observations [31].

This creative aspect of hypothesis formation isn’t anti-logical, but rather operates *prior* to rigorous testing [32]. Observations, while crucial, are rarely self-explanatory; researchers must actively *construct* potential explanations, often drawing upon prior knowledge, analogy, and even seemingly unrelated fields [31]. The ability to see connections where others do not, to formulate novel explanations, and to tolerate ambiguity are hallmarks of successful hypothesis generation [31]. This is particularly evident in instances like Kekulé’s dream of the benzene ring, where a subconscious intuitive process led to a breakthrough that could not be arrived at through purely logical analysis [32]. Ultimately, while rigorous testing and logical coherence are essential for validating hypotheses, the initial spark of inspiration frequently originates from intuitive insights and creative thought processes [1, 4]. 

The principle of parsimony, often referred to as Occam's Razor, serves as a crucial heuristic in scientific model building rather than a definitive arbiter between established theories [4, 5]. Historically, this principle advocates for selecting the simplest explanation with the fewest assumptions when multiple hypotheses equally explain available data [10]. This preference for simplicity isn't based on an aesthetic preference for elegance, but rather on the practical advantage of increased testability; simpler theories generally present more opportunities for falsification [4, 5]. Consequently, Occam’s Razor helps guide scientific inquiry by favoring explanations that can be readily subjected to empirical scrutiny, rather than complex constructions burdened with numerous, often untestable, additions [4, 5, 6]. However, it’s important to acknowledge that parsimony isn’t a rigid rule, but a flexible guideline [10]. Science remains open to more complex theories if future data necessitate them, recognizing that the “simplest” explanation at one point in time may be superseded by a more nuanced understanding as new evidence emerges [4, 5]. 

The application of parsimony also operates within specific contexts of inquiry, meaning that its reasonableness in one research area isn’t automatically transferable to another [10]. Its value lies in initially streamlining investigation, encouraging the selection of easily tested hypotheses before more elaborate explanations are considered, but should not preclude the acceptance of complexity when warranted by empirical findings [4, 5]. Ultimately, the consistent application of parsimony serves to both encourage and maintain the falsifiability of scientific theories [10]. By favoring explanations that require fewer assumptions, scientists are better positioned to design experiments and collect data that can rigorously test and potentially disprove their hypotheses [4, 5]. This process of iterative testing and refinement is central to the scientific method and ensures that the resulting theories are grounded in empirical evidence rather than arbitrary complexity [10].

Initially, a strong emphasis was placed on deductive reasoning, where theorems or established principles dictated expectations for observable phenomena [33]. This approach prioritized formal consistency and logical derivation; a theorem, once established, provided a firm basis for prediction, and empirical testing served largely to confirm or disconfirm those theoretically-derived expectations. However, this view faced challenges as observations often deviated from neat theoretical predictions, prompting a shift towards recognizing the limitations of purely deductive approaches [34]. A key refinement lies in understanding that empirical testing doesn’t simply confirm or refute a theorem in isolation, but rather assesses the broader theoretical framework within which that theorem is embedded [33]. 

Anomalies, or deviations from predictions, don’t necessarily invalidate the core theorem itself, but rather signal the need to refine auxiliary hypotheses, reassess underlying assumptions, or even modify the overarching theory [33]. This iterative process of theoretical refinement, driven by empirical findings, highlights that theorems are not static pronouncements, but rather provisional conclusions subject to ongoing revision in light of new evidence [34]. The emphasis moves from seeking singular “proof” to building robust, adaptive explanatory models. Furthermore, the interplay is often not unidirectional, with theory informing testing. Empirical observations can, and frequently do, *drive* theoretical development [34]. Unexpected findings, or the discovery of previously unknown phenomena, can necessitate the formulation of new theorems or the modification of existing ones to accommodate the observed reality. 

This inductive process, where generalizations are drawn from specific observations, complements the deductive approach, highlighting the cyclical and interactive relationship between theoretical formulation and empirical verification [34]. Ultimately, scientific progress relies on a dynamic interplay where theorems provide a framework for prediction, and empirical testing provides the critical feedback necessary for refinement and advancement [34].

## Evaluating Explanations: Testability & Falsifiability

A core tenet of establishing knowledge lies in distinguishing between correlation and causation, a challenge often addressed through controlled experiments [1, 12]. While observational studies can reveal relationships between variables, they are inherently susceptible to biases that confound interpretation [12, 22]. Observational bias arises because researchers are not manipulating variables but simply observing existing conditions, making it difficult to isolate the true cause of a phenomenon. This contrasts with controlled experiments, where researchers actively manipulate one or more variables while holding others constant, allowing for stronger inferences about causality [1].

However, even with controlled experimental design, challenges remain [12]. Researchers must account for potential confounding variables—factors other than the manipulated variable that could influence the outcome—through careful control and randomization [1]. Without these controls, observed effects may be attributed to the wrong cause, or the true effect may be masked [12].  True scientific progress relies on the ability of independent researchers to replicate findings; however, survey data suggests that outright “falsification”—demonstrably proving a concept wrong with conclusive data—is less common than concepts gradually falling out of favor as better explanations emerge [25]. 

This leads to a critical distinction between predictions and explanatory consequences. A critical aspect of evaluating hypotheses lies in differentiating between these, as while both involve deriving expectations from a hypothesis, their roles differ fundamentally. Predictions, in the strict sense, involve anticipating *novel* observations – outcomes not yet known at the time the hypothesis is formulated [13]. A successful prediction strengthens a hypothesis by demonstrating its ability to anticipate previously unknown phenomena. Conversely, explanatory consequences concern demonstrating how a hypothesis *accounts for* already known observations [3]. These are post-hoc justifications—demonstrating why something happened—and while valuable for supporting a hypothesis, they lack the same evidential weight as genuine predictions [12]. Peirce emphasized that while explanations are crucial for understanding, they don't inherently confirm a hypothesis [1].

Ultimately, the emphasis on predictive power highlights the importance of formulating theories that are not merely descriptive, but also capable of anticipating future observations.  Karl Popper’s criterion of falsifiability emerged as a key demarcation between scientific inquiry and other forms of knowledge, proposing that a scientific theory must be inherently disprovable through empirical testing [21]. This isn’t to say scientific theories are false, but rather that they must be formulated in a way that allows for the logical possibility of contradiction by observable evidence [21]. A theory that explains everything, or is immunized against potential falsification, ceases to be scientific as it loses its capacity to be rigorously tested [21]. This emphasis on testability contrasts with verificationist approaches, which sought to confirm theories through observation; Popper argued that conclusive verification is impossible, while falsification – demonstrating a theory’s incompatibility with evidence – is logically achievable [21]. 

The practical application of falsifiability involves formulating theories that make specific, potentially falsifiable predictions [28]. A universal law, to be scientific, must divide the class of basic statements (observable conditions) into those consistent with the theory and those that would disprove it [26]. This requirement pushes scientists to formulate precise hypotheses, rather than vague generalizations, allowing for clear empirical evaluation [21]. While Popper acknowledged the complexities of applying falsifiability in practice—including the reliance on background assumptions and the challenges of isolating specific falsifiers [12, 22]—he maintained that it serves as a crucial logical principle for evaluating scientific claims and fostering critical discussion [21]. 

However, it’s important to distinguish between the logical criterion of falsifiability and its methodological application [21]. Popper emphasized that falsifiability is a formal property of a theory, not a guarantee of its truth or a prescription for scientific practice [21]. While a falsifiable theory is a necessary condition for science, it is not sufficient; actual scientific progress requires careful observation, rigorous testing, and the willingness to revise or abandon theories in light of evidence [21]. The distinction clarifies that falsifiability is a tool for evaluating the logical structure of theories, rather than a rigid set of rules for conducting scientific research [21].

The foundations of robust scientific knowledge rest heavily on the principles of reproducibility and peer review. Survey responses indicate that the capacity to *test* a concept at all is a primary evaluation criterion [25], and a lack of testability severely limits its acceptance. However, even when testing is possible, scientists rarely rely solely on disproving alternative theories. Instead, they favor models with broad applicability, strong explanatory power, and a capacity to accommodate new data without requiring extensive modification [25]. A reluctance to definitively “falsify” established theories often stems from researchers' commitment to existing frameworks and a tendency to refine models incrementally rather than abandon them outright. 

Ultimately, the peer review process serves as a critical safeguard, but its efficacy depends on overcoming inherent biases and promoting open communication. While definitive falsification is often elusive, the collective scrutiny of the scientific community, coupled with a focus on replicability and transparent methodologies, remains essential for building reliable and robust scientific knowledge [25]. The emphasis on testability and broader explanatory power underscores that the goal isn’t simply to disprove alternatives, but to develop models that consistently align with observed phenomena and offer a compelling understanding of the natural world.

## Refining Explanations: Iteration & Philosophical Foundations

The progression of scientific understanding isn’t a linear accumulation of confirmed predictions, but a cyclical process involving feedback loops between observation, hypothesis, experimentation, and interpretation [1, 12]. This iterative process is fundamental to the refinement of theories and the advancement of knowledge, demanding a willingness to challenge established frameworks in light of new evidence [1, 12]. Initial observations or theoretical propositions generate hypotheses, which are then tested through experimentation, and the outcomes don't simply *confirm* or *deny* a hypothesis in isolation; they provide data that feeds back into refinement, or the generation of entirely new ones [22, 15].

### The Role of Anomalies and Unexpected Results in Theory Revision

Anomalies – observations that contradict prevailing theoretical frameworks – are not simply errors to be discarded, but critical catalysts for theory revision [1]. The historical record demonstrates that major scientific revolutions often originate from the recognition and investigation of these anomalies [1].  Initial responses often involve attempts to reconcile the anomaly within the existing paradigm, perhaps by refining auxiliary hypotheses or reinterpreting data [12]. However, a cumulative burden of anomalies can force scientists to confront the limitations of their current understanding and actively seek alternative explanations that better account for the observed phenomena. While initial responses may focus on preserving existing frameworks, a commitment to empirical observation and logical consistency necessitates a willingness to revise or even abandon theories when confronted with persistent and compelling anomalous results [1, 12]. This ongoing cycle of observation, anomaly detection, and theory revision is fundamental to the advancement of scientific knowledge [12].

### Feedback Loops in Scientific Progress: Theory & Experiment

This cyclical process underscores that scientific knowledge isn’t a static body of facts, but a dynamic, self-correcting system driven by the continuous feedback between theory and experiment [12]. Critically, the evaluation of competing models isn’t solely driven by strict falsifiability but by a complex interplay of explanatory power, testability, and pragmatic considerations [12, 22]. Models offering broader applicability and amenable to rigorous testing tend to gain prominence, even if they aren’t entirely free of anomalies [12]. The active seeking of data to *challenge* existing models is fundamental, but it’s rarely a complete “yes” or “no” outcome [22, 15]. Instead, the scientific community often operates within a framework of incremental refinement, continually modifying existing models to accommodate new observations and extend their explanatory power [12].

### Epistemological Challenges: Justification & the Limits of Knowledge

The pursuit of justified belief, however, leads to fundamental epistemological challenges. A central concern lies in the justification of beliefs acquired through testimony – while testimony is indispensable, establishing *how* we can legitimately acquire knowledge from another’s say-so remains contentious [7]. One primary division lies between reductionist and non-reductionist views. Reductionists argue that testimonial justification isn’t basic; rather, it must ultimately be grounded in other epistemic sources like perception or inference, requiring “positive reasons” for believing a speaker is reliable [7]. This position faces difficulties, as it potentially sets an unreasonably high bar for everyday testimonial acceptance and struggles to account for how we initially acquire reasons to trust others [7]. Conversely, non-reductionists maintain that we have a “defeasible but presumptive right” to believe what others tell us, absent specific reasons for doubt [7]. This view circumvents the demanding requirements of reductionism, but risks justifying irrational gullibility if any assertion is accepted without critical assessment [7]. 

### Addressing Infinite Regress in Justification (Scotus’s Rejection)

This debate highlights a broader issue: the potential for infinite regress in attempts to justify beliefs. If every belief requires justification by another belief, and so on *ad infinitum*, no foundational knowledge seems possible. Many medieval philosophers sought to resolve this by positing self-evident or divine illumination as ultimate foundations. John Duns Scotus, however, offered a distinctly different approach, rejecting the necessity of an infinite chain of justifications [5]. Scotus argued for the possibility of ‘ultimate’ propositions whose intelligibility doesn’t *require* further justification, though they are not necessarily self-evident in the manner proposed by some rationalists [5]. This is achieved through the concept of the *haecceitas* – a ‘thisness’ or individual essence – which grounds propositions in a unique, non-conceptual intuition. Central to Scotus’s position is a distinction between *formal* and *material* necessity [5]. Formal necessity arises from the logical connections between concepts – the kind of necessity requiring further justification within a system of reasoning. Material necessity, however, stems from the intuitive grasp of individual essences – a direct apprehension of ‘whatness’ that terminates the chain of justification. This doesn’t imply that such propositions are simply *felt* to be true, but rather that their intelligibility resides in the direct apprehension of the essence they describe, rendering further justification superfluous [5]. Scotus’s rejection of the need for infinite regress thus isn't a denial of the *possibility* of further analysis, but a claim that such analysis is not *required* for justification, emphasizing an intuitive grasp of individual essences as a grounding for knowledge [5].





## Conclusion

The initial inquiry, “Why?”, prompted an investigation into the historical and methodological foundations of explanation itself. This research moved beyond a simple search for causal mechanisms to examine *how* explanations have been constructed across time, from mythological narratives and teleological frameworks to modern scientific methods emphasizing deduction, induction, and abduction. The inquiry evolved from seeking a singular answer to understanding the *process* of answering – recognizing that explanation isn’t a static endpoint but a dynamic, iterative cycle driven by observation, hypothesis, and ongoing refinement.

Key discoveries centered on the interplay between these reasoning methods and the crucial role of anomalies in driving theoretical progress. While deduction and induction remain essential, the research highlighted abductive reasoning as the initial spark for hypothesis generation, emphasizing the role of creative inference and intuitive leaps. The importance of falsifiability—the ability to disprove a hypothesis—emerged as a cornerstone of scientific rigor, distinguishing testable claims from unfalsifiable assertions. This investigation revealed that explanatory power isn’t merely about confirming existing knowledge, but about anticipating novel phenomena and adapting theories in light of unexpected results. 

Ultimately, the research demonstrates that explanation is fundamentally a process of constructing coherent narratives that align with empirical observation. This process isn’t purely logical or objective, but is deeply intertwined with historical context, philosophical assumptions, and the inherent limitations of human perception and reasoning. While the pursuit of “Why?” may never yield a definitive, universal answer, the investigation reveals that the *manner* in which we seek explanations—embracing iteration, acknowledging anomalies, and prioritizing testability—is central to advancing our understanding of the world. The exploration moved beyond simply identifying causal relationships to understanding the multifaceted, evolving nature of explanation itself, revealing a complex interplay of logic, intuition, and historical context.
